    "You are a game-playing agent in a 2D grid-based environment. Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Your Task:\n",
    "You are **not** expected to solve the game for a specific instance.  \n",
    "Instead, your task is to **write pseudocode** that outlines a general strategy for solving any valid instance of this game.  \n",
    "Your pseudocode should describe an algorithm that works on **any grid** and under **any valid configuration** of the objects and the agent’s starting direction. The score will be based on the number of steps taken, so the fewer steps you take, the better your score.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Environment Description:\n",
    "- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n",
    "  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n",
    "- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n",
    "- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Actions:\n",
    "You can perform the following actions:\n",
    "- `LEFT`: Turn 90° to the left.\n",
    "- `RIGHT`: Turn 90° to the right.\n",
    "- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n",
    "- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n",
    "- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n",
    "- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rules:\n",
    "- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n",
    "- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you’re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n",
    "- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n",
    "  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n",
    "  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n",
    "- You cannot:\n",
    "  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it’s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n",
    "  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n",
    "  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n",
