Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nLEFT\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n    [\"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. The agent starts at [6,3] facing LEFT (i.e. west). First, he needs to grab the KEY at [4,1]. Since the KEY sits in a cell and cannot be stepped on, the agent must remain adjacent to it and then use the PICKUP instruction. A good plan is to approach the KEY from below.\n\n\u2022 Action 1: \"MOVE\" \u2192 from [6,3] to [6,2].  \n\u2022 Action 2: \"MOVE\" \u2192 from [6,2] to [6,1].\n\n2. Next, turn to face UP (north) so the KEY's cell [4,1] becomes directly in front (when approaching from [5,1]).  \n\u2022 Action 3: \"RIGHT\" \u2192 from facing LEFT to facing NORTH.\n\n3. Move upward:  \n\u2022 Action 4: \"MOVE\" \u2192 from [6,1] to [5,1].\n\n4. With the KEY at [4,1] now in the cell ahead, use the PICKUP command:  \n\u2022 Action 5: \"PICKUP\" (this picks up the KEY from [4,1] while the agent is at [5,1] and facing north).\n\n5. After picking up the KEY, the agent must head to the DOOR at [2,4]. To avoid entering cells with objects, travel via empty cells in your current room. A good route is from [5,1] upward then east.\n\n\u2022 Action 6: \"MOVE\" \u2192 from [5,1] to [4,1] (the KEY cell is now empty).  \n\u2022 Action 7: \"MOVE\" \u2192 from [4,1] to [3,1].  \n\u2022 Action 8: \"MOVE\" \u2192 from [3,1] to [2,1].\n\n6. At [2,1] the agent now turns to face east so that the DOOR (which lies on the boundary) becomes accessible on the right.  \n\u2022 Action 9: \"RIGHT\" \u2192 from NORTH to EAST.\n\n7. The agent moves right toward the cell from which he can unlock the door:  \n\u2022 Action 10: \"MOVE\" \u2192 from [2,1] to [2,2].  \n\u2022 Action 11: \"MOVE\" \u2192 from [2,2] to [2,3].  \nAt this point [2,3] is immediately left of the DOOR at [2,4] (remember: the door is the only gap between the two rooms).\n\n8. With the agent now at [2,3] facing east and holding the KEY, use the UNLOCK command:  \n\u2022 Action 12: \"UNLOCK\" \u2192 this unlocks the DOOR at [2,4].\n\n9. After unlocking, step forward through the door:  \n\u2022 Action 13: \"MOVE\" \u2192 from [2,3] into the door cell [2,4].  \n\u2022 Action 14: \"MOVE\" \u2192 move further east into [2,5] (inside the right room).  \n\u2022 Action 15: \"MOVE\" \u2192 move to [2,6].\n\n10. Now in the right room, the GOAL is at [6,6]. Change direction to go downwards:  \n\u2022 Action 16: \"RIGHT\" \u2192 from EAST to SOUTH.\n\n11. Finally, move down the right room corridor:  \n\u2022 Action 17: \"MOVE\" \u2192 from [2,6] to [3,6].  \n\u2022 Action 18: \"MOVE\" \u2192 from [3,6] to [4,6].  \n\u2022 Action 19: \"MOVE\" \u2192 from [4,6] to [5,6].  \n\u2022 Action 20: \"MOVE\" \u2192 from [5,6] to [6,6] (which is where the GOAL is located).\n\nThis series of actions guides the agent from his starting cell in the left room, to pick up the KEY, unlock the DOOR (the only passageway), and finally enter the right room to reach the GOAL."}
