Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nLEFT\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n    [\"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the reasoning behind the chosen sequence:\n\n1. Starting at cell [6,2] facing LEFT, turn RIGHT so you face UP.\n2. MOVE upward four times to go from [6,2] to [2,2]:\n   - [6,2] \u2192 [5,2]\n   - [5,2] \u2192 [4,2]\n   - [4,2] \u2192 [3,2]\n   - [3,2] \u2192 [2,2]\n3. At [2,2] facing UP, turn RIGHT so you now face east; the KEY is in the cell [2,3] directly ahead.\n4. PICKUP the KEY from [2,3] (note that you do not enter the cell with the object but pick it up from adjacent cell).\n5. Then MOVE east twice:\n   - From [2,2] to [2,3] (now empty since the KEY was picked up)\n   - From [2,3] to [2,4]\n6. Turn LEFT (facing east \u2192 now facing UP) so you can move north.\n7. MOVE north from [2,4] to [1,4]. Here, [1,4] is adjacent to the DOOR which is located at [1,5] in the wall that connects the rooms.\n8. Turn RIGHT (from UP to EAST) to face the door.\n9. UNLOCK the DOOR at [1,5] while holding the KEY.\n10. MOVE into the door cell at [1,5] and then MOVE again to [1,6] which is in the room that contains the GOAL.\n11. Turn RIGHT (from EAST to DOWN) to face downward.\n12. Finally, MOVE downward five times to go through cells [2,6] \u2192 [3,6] \u2192 [4,6] \u2192 [5,6] \u2192 [6,6] where the GOAL resides.\n\nThis sequence ensures you pick up the key, unlock the door, and then traverse into the goal room and step onto the GOAL cell as required."}
