Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nLEFT\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n[\"LEFT\",\n \"MOVE\",\n \"MOVE\",\n \"MOVE\",\n \"MOVE\",\n \"MOVE\",\n \"LEFT\",\n \"PICKUP\",\n \"MOVE\",\n \"MOVE\",\n \"LEFT\",\n \"MOVE\",\n \"MOVE\",\n \"MOVE\",\n \"MOVE\",\n \"RIGHT\",\n \"UNLOCK\",\n \"MOVE\",\n \"MOVE\",\n \"RIGHT\",\n \"MOVE\",\n \"MOVE\",\n \"MOVE\",\n \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nDetailed Explanation:\n1. Starting at (1,2) facing LEFT, we first turn LEFT so that we face DOWN.\n2. We then MOVE five times to go from row 1 to row 6 while staying in column 2.\n3. Now at (6,2) facing DOWN, we turn LEFT so that we now face RIGHT. The KEY is located at (6,3), directly ahead.\n4. We execute PICKUP (from (6,2) picking up the KEY from (6,3)).\n5. With the KEY in hand, we want to re-orient toward the door. We first MOVE from (6,2) into (6,3) (now empty) and then MOVE into (6,4).\n6. At (6,4) facing RIGHT, we need to head upward to the door\u2019s approach cell ((2,4) so that the door at (2,5) is directly in front). We turn LEFT to face UP and then MOVE four times to go from row 6 to row 2.\n7. At (2,4) facing UP, we turn RIGHT so that we face the door at (2,5) and then execute UNLOCK.\n8. With the door unlocked, we MOVE into the door cell, and then MOVE again into the adjacent right\u2010room cell.\n9. In the right room our goal (GOAL) is at (6,6). From our current position, we turn RIGHT (from facing RIGHT to facing DOWN) and then MOVE four times to reach row 6, column 6.\n10. Standing on the GOAL completes the game.\n\nThis sequence satisfies the objective."}
