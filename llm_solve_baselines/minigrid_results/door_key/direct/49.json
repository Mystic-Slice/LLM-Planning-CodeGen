Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nRIGHT\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions> \n\nHere's the explanation for each action:\n\n1. \"LEFT\": From the initial facing (RIGHT), turn left to face UP.\n2. \"MOVE\": Move from (4,1) to (3,1). Now the KEY at (2,1) is directly in front.\n3. \"PICKUP\": Pick up the KEY from cell (2,1).\n4. \"RIGHT\": Turn from UP to RIGHT so that the DOOR at (3,2) is directly ahead.\n5. \"UNLOCK\": Unlock the DOOR (using the held KEY) located at (3,2).\n6. \"MOVE\": Step into the door's cell at (3,2), entering the second room.\n7. \"MOVE\": Move right from (3,2) to (3,3).\n8. \"MOVE\": Continue moving right from (3,3) to (3,4).\n9. \"MOVE\": Move right from (3,4) to (3,5).\n10. \"MOVE\": Move right from (3,5) to (3,6). Now near the column of the GOAL.\n11. \"RIGHT\": Turn right (from facing RIGHT) to face DOWN.\n12. \"MOVE\": Move down from (3,6) to (4,6).\n13. \"MOVE\": Move down from (4,6) to (5,6).\n14. \"MOVE\": Move down from (5,6) to (6,6), reaching the GOAL.\n\nFollowing this sequence, the agent collects the KEY, unlocks the DOOR, and navigates into the appropriate room to finally stand on the GOAL cell."}
