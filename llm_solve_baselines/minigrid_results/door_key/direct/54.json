Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nRIGHT\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n    [\"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. Start at [4,1] facing RIGHT. To go toward the KEY (at [6,1]), turn RIGHT to face DOWN.\n2. MOVE from [4,1] to [5,1].\n3. From [5,1] (facing DOWN), the KEY is right ahead at [6,1] so PICKUP the KEY.\n4. Now, you need to unlock the DOOR. The door is at [5,3]. To unlock it, you should stand at [5,2] with the door directly in front. From [5,1] (facing DOWN), turn LEFT to face RIGHT.\n5. MOVE from [5,1] to [5,2].\n6. With the door now in your front cell ([5,3]) and holding the KEY, use UNLOCK.\n7. MOVE from [5,2] into the door cell ([5,3]).\n8. Now in the right room, proceed RIGHT: MOVE from [5,3] to [5,4].\n9. MOVE from [5,4] to [5,5].\n10. MOVE from [5,5] to [5,6].\n11. The GOAL is one cell down at [6,6]. Turn RIGHT (from facing RIGHT to facing DOWN).\n12. MOVE from [5,6] to [6,6] to complete the game.\n\nThis sequence of actions meets the game\u2019s objective of picking up the KEY, unlocking the DOOR, and reaching the GOAL."}
