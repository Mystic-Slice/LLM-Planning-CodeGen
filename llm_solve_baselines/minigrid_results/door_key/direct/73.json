Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nDOWN\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n[\"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. Start at (6,2) facing DOWN. To reach the KEY at (5,4) without entering its cell (since objects block entry), we need to stand at (6,4) and face UP.\n   - \"LEFT\": From DOWN, turning left makes you face RIGHT.\n   - \"MOVE\": Walk from (6,2) to (6,3).\n   - \"MOVE\": Walk from (6,3) to (6,4).\n   - \"LEFT\": With current facing RIGHT, turning left makes you face UP.\n   - \"PICKUP\": Now that (5,4) (directly above) holds the KEY, pick it up.\n\n2. With the key in hand, you must now go to the door at (1,5) (which connects your starting room with the GOAL room). Stand at (1,4) (immediately left of the door) and face RIGHT.\n   - \"MOVE\": From (6,4) (facing UP) move to (5,4).\n   - \"MOVE\": Then to (4,4).\n   - \"MOVE\": Then to (3,4).\n   - \"MOVE\": Then to (2,4).\n   - \"MOVE\": Finally to (1,4).\n   - \"RIGHT\": From facing UP at (1,4), a right turn makes you face RIGHT toward the door.\n   - \"UNLOCK\": With the KEY in hand, unlock the door located at (1,5).\n\n3. Having unlocked the door, proceed into the adjacent room (where the GOAL is) and aim to reach the goal at (6,6).\n   - \"MOVE\": Step into the door cell at (1,5).\n   - \"MOVE\": Move from (1,5) to (1,6), which is in the GOAL room.\n   - \"RIGHT\": From facing RIGHT, turning right makes you face DOWN.\n   - \"MOVE\": Move down successively from (1,6) to (2,6).\n   - \"MOVE\": Then to (3,6).\n   - \"MOVE\": Then to (4,6).\n   - \"MOVE\": Then to (5,6).\n   - \"MOVE\": Finally, arrive at (6,6) where the GOAL is located.\n\nThis sequence of 20 actions guides you from your starting position to pick up the KEY, unlock the DOOR, and then proceed to stand on the GOAL, completing the game."}
