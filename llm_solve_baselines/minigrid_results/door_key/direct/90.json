Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nLEFT\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n[\"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nBelow is an explanation of the plan:\n\n1. You start at [1,2] facing LEFT. The KEY is at [4,1] and you must not step into its cell but rather pick it up by standing adjacent and facing it.\n2. First, you move left from [1,2] to [1,1]. Then turn LEFT to face DOWN so you can head toward the KEY.\n3. You MOVE twice (from [1,1] to [2,1] then [3,1]). Now, you turn LEFT (when facing DOWN, a left turn rotates you to face EAST) and MOVE to [3,2].\n4. To go one cell down to [4,2] (which is adjacent to the KEY at [4,1]), you turn RIGHT (from EAST to SOUTH) then MOVE.\n5. At [4,2] facing SOUTH, you turn RIGHT (SOUTH \u2192 WEST) so that you are now facing the KEY. You then PICKUP the KEY.\n6. With the KEY in hand, you must now reach the DOOR at [2,4]. From [4,2] (facing WEST), you turn RIGHT (WEST \u2192 NORTH) and MOVE twice to reach [2,2]. Then, by turning RIGHT (NORTH \u2192 EAST) and MOVE once, you position yourself at [2,3] with the DOOR directly in front.\n7. You then UNLOCK the door.\n8. After unlocking, you MOVE into the door cell ([2,4]) then MOVE again into the adjacent cell ([2,5]) in the right room.\n9. Next, to reach the GOAL at [6,6], from [2,5] facing EAST you turn RIGHT (EAST \u2192 SOUTH) and MOVE down four times until you reach [6,5].\n10. Finally, turning LEFT (SOUTH \u2192 EAST) and MOVE brings you into the GOAL at [6,6].\n\nThis series of 25 actions completes your objectives."}
