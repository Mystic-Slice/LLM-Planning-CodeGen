Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nLEFT\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n[\"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions> \n\nExplanation:\n1. Starting at (5,1) facing LEFT, turn RIGHT to face UP.\n2. MOVE three times to go from (5,1) \u2192 (4,1) \u2192 (3,1) \u2192 (2,1). Now you stand directly below the KEY at (1,1).\n3. PICKUP picks the KEY from the cell (1,1) (which is directly in front of you while facing UP).\n4. Now, to return to the door, turn RIGHT twice (from UP to RIGHT, then to DOWN).\n5. MOVE twice to go from (2,1) \u2192 (3,1) \u2192 (4,1).\n6. At (4,1) facing DOWN, turn LEFT so you\u2019re facing RIGHT toward the DOOR at (4,2).\n7. With the KEY in hand, UNLOCK the DOOR.\n8. MOVE into the door cell (from (4,1) to (4,2)).\n9. MOVE again to (4,3) still facing RIGHT.\n10. Turn RIGHT from facing RIGHT so that you now face DOWN.\n11. MOVE twice to progress from (4,3) \u2192 (5,3) \u2192 (6,3).\n12. From (6,3) facing DOWN, turn LEFT to face RIGHT.\n13. Finally, MOVE three times along row 6 from (6,3) to (6,4), then (6,4) to (6,5), and finally (6,5) to (6,6) where the GOAL is located.\n\nThis sequence of actions collects the KEY, unlocks the DOOR, and navigates to the GOAL cell."}
