Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nDOWN\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n[\"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the step\u2010by\u2010step explanation:\n\n1. Our starting point is at cell [5,1] facing DOWN. We first need to get the KEY at cell [2,1] without stepping into it (since objects block movement). We turn twice to face UP:\n   - \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\"  (now facing UP)\n\n2. We then move from [5,1] upward:\n   - \"MOVE\": goes to [4,1]\n   - \"MOVE\": goes to [3,1]\n\n3. With the agent at [3,1] (facing UP), the KEY is directly ahead at [2,1]. We execute:\n   - \"PICKUP\"  (now holding the KEY)\n\n4. Now we want to get to the DOOR at [1,2]. We first need to move up into the now-empty [2,1] and then to [1,1]:\n   - \"MOVE\": [3,1] \u2192 [2,1]\n   - \"MOVE\": [2,1] \u2192 [1,1]\n\n5. At [1,1] the DOOR is located to the RIGHT at cell [1,2]. Rotate to face RIGHT:\n   - \"RIGHT\"\n\n6. With the KEY in hand and facing the door, we unlock it:\n   - \"UNLOCK\"\n\n7. Now that the door is unlocked, we move into the door cell and then into the adjoining room:\n   - \"MOVE\": from [1,1] \u2192 [1,2] (door cell)\n   - \"MOVE\": from [1,2] \u2192 [1,3] (into the right room)\n\n8. The GOAL is at [6,6] in the right room. From [1,3] (currently facing RIGHT) we need to navigate downward then right:\n   - Turn to face DOWN by turning right (from RIGHT, \"RIGHT\" gives DOWN):\n     - \"RIGHT\"\n   - Move down to row 6:\n     - \"MOVE\": [1,3] \u2192 [2,3]\n     - \"MOVE\": [2,3] \u2192 [3,3]\n     - \"MOVE\": [3,3] \u2192 [4,3]\n     - \"MOVE\": [4,3] \u2192 [5,3]\n     - \"MOVE\": [5,3] \u2192 [6,3]\n     \n9. At [6,3] (facing DOWN) the GOAL at [6,6] lies to the right (East). Turn left from DOWN (which faces you East):\n   - \"LEFT\"\n   \n10. Finally, move right until you reach the GOAL:\n    - \"MOVE\": [6,3] \u2192 [6,4]\n    - \"MOVE\": [6,4] \u2192 [6,5]\n    - \"MOVE\": [6,5] \u2192 [6,6]  (standing on the GOAL)\n\nThe resulting sequence of 21 actions achieves the objective: picking up the key, unlocking the door, and finally reaching the goal."}
