Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"AGENT\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nRIGHT\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n[\"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. The agent starts at (3,2) facing RIGHT. The KEY is at (3,1) (to the WEST). To face WEST from RIGHT, the agent turns LEFT twice:\n   \u2022 \"LEFT\" (RIGHT \u2192 UP)\n   \u2022 \"LEFT\" (UP \u2192 LEFT)\n\n2. With the agent facing WEST, a \"PICKUP\" grabs the KEY in cell (3,1).\n\n3. Now, the agent must unlock the DOOR at (3,3), which lies to the EAST of its current position. From facing WEST, the agent turns RIGHT twice:\n   \u2022 \"RIGHT\" (WEST \u2192 NORTH)\n   \u2022 \"RIGHT\" (NORTH \u2192 EAST)\n\n4. Facing EAST, the agent uses \"UNLOCK\" to unlock the DOOR in front (at (3,3)).\n\n5. Next, the agent must enter the door cell to reach the room with the GOAL. A \"MOVE\" takes the agent from (3,2) to (3,3).\n\n6. Another \"MOVE\" moves it from (3,3) to (3,4) deeper into the right room.\n\n7. The GOAL is at (6,6). From (3,4) the agent turns \"RIGHT\" (facing EAST \u2192 SOUTH) so it can start moving downward.\n\n8. Three \"MOVE\" actions bring it down:\n   \u2022 \"MOVE\": from (3,4) to (4,4)\n   \u2022 \"MOVE\": from (4,4) to (5,4)\n   \u2022 \"MOVE\": from (5,4) to (6,4)\n\n9. With the agent now at (6,4) and the GOAL at (6,6) (to the EAST), a \"LEFT\" turn (when facing SOUTH, left \u2192 EAST) aligns the agent with the goal horizontally.\n\n10. Finally, two \"MOVE\" actions navigate:\n    \u2022 \"MOVE\": from (6,4) to (6,5)\n    \u2022 \"MOVE\": from (6,5) to (6,6)\n\nStanding on the GOAL cell completes the objective."}
