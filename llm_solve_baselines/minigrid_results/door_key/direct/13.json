Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"WALL\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nUP\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the reasoning behind the plan:\n\n1. Starting at row6, col4 facing UP, the key is at (1,1) but you must PICKUP only when the key is directly ahead. So first, you navigate from (6,4) to a cell immediately below the key.\n   - Turn LEFT to face LEFT.\n   - Move three times to go from (6,4) \u2192 (6,3) \u2192 (6,2) \u2192 (6,1).\n\n2. At (6,1) (facing LEFT), you need to go north (UP) so that you can later stand at (2,1) with the key (at (1,1)) directly ahead.\n   - Turn RIGHT (from LEFT, this reorients you UP).\n   - Move upward four times: (6,1) \u2192 (5,1) \u2192 (4,1) \u2192 (3,1) \u2192 (2,1).\n\n3. Now at (2,1) facing UP, the cell in front (1,1) holds the KEY.\n   - PICKUP the key.\n\n4. With the key in hand, you need to go to the DOOR at (1,5). To approach it correctly, plan a route so that you end up adjacent to the door.\n   - First, move UP from (2,1) to (1,1). \n   - Then turn RIGHT to face toward the door.\n   - Move three times from (1,1) \u2192 (1,2) \u2192 (1,3) \u2192 (1,4).\n   - Now, facing RIGHT at (1,4), the door sits directly in front at (1,5).\n   - UNLOCK the door.\n\n5. With the door unlocked, cross through it and head into the room with the GOAL.\n   - MOVE from (1,4) into the door cell (1,5).\n   - MOVE again from (1,5) into (1,6), which places you in the room with the GOAL.\n   - Turn RIGHT to face DOWN.\n\n6. Finally, move down to reach the GOAL at (6,6):\n   - Move five times: (1,6) \u2192 (2,6) \u2192 (3,6) \u2192 (4,6) \u2192 (5,6) \u2192 (6,6).\n\nStanding on the GOAL cell completes the game."}
