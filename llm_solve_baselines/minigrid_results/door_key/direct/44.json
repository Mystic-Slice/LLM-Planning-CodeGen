Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nDOWN\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n[\"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nExplanation:\n1. Starting at (5,1) facing DOWN, turn LEFT to face EAST.\n2. MOVE from (5,1) to (5,2).\n3. Turn LEFT (from EAST to NORTH) to head upward.\n4. MOVE from (5,2) to (4,2).\n5. Turn RIGHT (from NORTH to EAST) so that the cell directly in front (4,3) holds the KEY.\n6. PICKUP the KEY from (4,3).\n7. Now, still at (4,2) facing EAST, turn LEFT (to face NORTH) to head toward the door.\n8\u201310. MOVE three times upward: (4,2)\u2192(3,2)\u2192(2,2)\u2192(1,2).\n11. Turn RIGHT (from NORTH to EAST) so that (1,3) becomes your new position with the DOOR cell immediately in front.\n12. MOVE from (1,2) to (1,3).\n13. With the door directly ahead at (1,4) and holding the KEY, UNLOCK the DOOR.\n14. MOVE into the door cell (1,4) (now unlocked).\n15. MOVE further EAST into (1,5), entering the right-hand room.\n16. Turn RIGHT (from EAST to SOUTH) to start descending.\n17\u201321. MOVE 5 times SOUTH: (1,5)\u2192(2,5)\u2192(3,5)\u2192(4,5)\u2192(5,5)\u2192(6,5).\n22. Turn LEFT (from SOUTH to EAST) so that the GOAL is directly ahead.\n23. MOVE from (6,5) to (6,6) to stand on the GOAL cell.\n\nThis sequence achieves the objective: pick up the key, unlock the door to access the other room, and reach the goal."}
