Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nUP\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n[\"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the step\u2010by\u2010step plan:\n\n1. Starting at (1,1) facing UP, we first want to face DOWN so we can go toward the key at (4,1). We do this by turning 90\u00b0 right twice.\n2. Then we move forward twice:\n   - From (1,1) to (2,1)\n   - From (2,1) to (3,1)\n3. With the agent now at (3,1) facing DOWN, the KEY is immediately in front (at (4,1)), so we issue PICKUP.\n4. Next, we move down twice to reach (5,1):\n   - MOVE from (3,1) to (4,1) (where the key was)\n   - MOVE from (4,1) to (5,1)\n5. At (5,1) while still facing DOWN, the door lies to the right (at (5,2)). To face it, we turn LEFT (from DOWN, a left turn faces RIGHT).\n6. With the door directly ahead and holding the key, we use UNLOCK.\n7. Then we enter the door area by moving forward into (5,2).\n8. Now in the second (right) room and still facing RIGHT, we traverse toward the goal:\n   - MOVE from (5,2) to (5,3)\n   - MOVE from (5,3) to (5,4)\n   - MOVE from (5,4) to (5,5)\n   - MOVE from (5,5) to (5,6)\n9. Finally, at (5,6) (facing RIGHT), we turn RIGHT (so that from RIGHT we now face DOWN) and MOVE into (6,6) where the GOAL is located.\n\nThis complete sequence of 16 actions unlocks the door and guides you safely to the goal."}
