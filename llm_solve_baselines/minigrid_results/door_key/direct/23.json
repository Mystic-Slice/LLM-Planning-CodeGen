Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nLEFT\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions> \n\nHere's the reasoning step\u2010by\u2010step:\n\n1. The Agent starts at (3,1) facing LEFT. To get the KEY below (row5, col1), the agent must first face DOWN. A LEFT turn (from LEFT) makes the agent face DOWN.\n2. Then, a MOVE from (3,1) to (4,1) positions the agent so that the KEY is directly in front (at (5,1)).\n3. A PICKUP retrieves the KEY from (5,1) without entering that cell.\n4. Now holding the KEY, the agent must go unlock the DOOR at (2,2). The current position is (4,1) and the agent is facing DOWN. To head upward, it must turn so that it faces UP. Two LEFT turns will do: from DOWN to RIGHT, then from RIGHT to UP.\n5. With the agent facing UP, two consecutive MOVEs bring it from (4,1) up to (3,1) and then to (2,1).\n6. The DOOR is to the right of (2,1) (at (2,2)). A RIGHT turn from UP makes the agent face RIGHT.\n7. Now the agent uses UNLOCK (while holding the KEY) to unlock the DOOR that\u2019s directly in front.\n8. A MOVE brings the agent into the door cell (2,2) and a subsequent MOVE moves it further to (2,3) \u2013 thus entering the room that contains the GOAL.\n9. The GOAL is at (6,6) in the lower right area. At (2,3) and facing RIGHT, the agent turns RIGHT to face DOWN.\n10. Four MOVEs send the agent down the column: from (2,3) to (3,3), then (4,3), (5,3), and finally (6,3).\n11. At (6,3) facing DOWN, the agent then turns LEFT to face RIGHT (since from DOWN a LEFT turn faces RIGHT).\n12. Finally, three MOVEs move the agent from (6,3) rightwards: to (6,4), then (6,5), and finally (6,6) where the GOAL is located.\n\nThis sequence unlocks the DOOR, lets the Agent transit into the other room, and ultimately reach the GOAL."}
