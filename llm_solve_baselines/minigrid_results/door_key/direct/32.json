Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nDOWN\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n[\"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. You start at (3,2) facing DOWN.  \n   \u2022 \"MOVE\" \u2192 to (4,2)  \n   \u2022 \"MOVE\" \u2192 to (5,2)\n\n2. At (5,2), the KEY is located at (5,1) (directly to the WEST). Since you are facing DOWN, you must turn so that \u201cin front\u201d is (5,1).  \n   \u2022 \"RIGHT\" \u2192 From facing DOWN, turning RIGHT makes you face WEST.  \n   \u2022 \"PICKUP\" \u2192 Pick up the KEY from (5,1).\n\n3. Now holding the key at (5,2) and facing WEST, you need to go toward the DOOR at (2,5). In the left-hand room (columns 1\u20134), the accessible cell adjacent to the door is (2,4). To get there:  \n   \u2022 \"RIGHT\" \u2192 From facing WEST, turning RIGHT makes you face NORTH.  \n   \u2022 \"MOVE\" \u2192 from (5,2) to (4,2)  \n   \u2022 \"MOVE\" \u2192 from (4,2) to (3,2)  \n   \u2022 \"MOVE\" \u2192 from (3,2) to (2,2)\n\n4. At (2,2) facing NORTH, you now need to head east to reach (2,4) so that the door at (2,5) is directly in front.  \n   \u2022 \"RIGHT\" \u2192 From NORTH, turning RIGHT makes you face EAST.  \n   \u2022 \"MOVE\" \u2192 from (2,2) to (2,3)  \n   \u2022 \"MOVE\" \u2192 from (2,3) to (2,4)\n\n5. Standing at (2,4) and facing EAST, the DOOR is immediately ahead at (2,5). Since you have the KEY, unlock it:  \n   \u2022 \"UNLOCK\" \u2192 Unlock the DOOR at (2,5).\n\n6. With the door unlocked, you can now go through.  \n   \u2022 \"MOVE\" \u2192 step into the door cell (2,5)  \n   \u2022 \"MOVE\" \u2192 move from (2,5) to (2,6) in the right-hand room\n\n7. Finally, reach the GOAL at (6,6) by moving downward. From your current orientation (facing EAST):  \n   \u2022 \"RIGHT\" \u2192 From EAST, turning RIGHT makes you face SOUTH.  \n   \u2022 \"MOVE\" \u2192 from (2,6) to (3,6)  \n   \u2022 \"MOVE\" \u2192 from (3,6) to (4,6)  \n   \u2022 \"MOVE\" \u2192 from (4,6) to (5,6)  \n   \u2022 \"MOVE\" \u2192 from (5,6) to (6,6) where the GOAL is located.\n\nThis ordered list of actions meets the objective of obtaining the key, unlocking the door, and reaching the goal."}
