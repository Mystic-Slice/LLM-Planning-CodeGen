Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nDOWN\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. The agent starts at (5,1) facing DOWN. To get to the KEY at (1,1) (which is in the cell directly north of row 2, col1), the agent must first face UP. Two left turns (\u201cLEFT\u201d, \u201cLEFT\u201d) will do that.\n2. Then three \u201cMOVE\u201d actions advance from (5,1) \u2192 (4,1) \u2192 (3,1) \u2192 (2,1). Now, from (2,1) facing UP, the KEY is immediately in front at (1,1), so \u201cPICKUP\u201d collects it.\n3. With the key in hand, the agent needs to return toward the DOOR at (3,2). From (2,1) facing UP, two left turns (\u201cLEFT\u201d, \u201cLEFT\u201d) change the direction to DOWN.\n4. A \u201cMOVE\u201d from (2,1) (facing DOWN) brings the agent to (3,1). The door is to the right of (3,1), so one \u201cLEFT\u201d turn (since from DOWN, left yields RIGHT) makes the agent face the DOOR.\n5. \u201cUNLOCK\u201d then unlocks the door (located at (3,2)), letting the agent pass.\n6. Two \u201cMOVE\u201d actions allow the agent to step into the door cell (first into (3,2) then into (3,3) in the right room).\n7. In the right room, to head toward the GOAL at (6,6), the agent turns \u201cRIGHT\u201d (from RIGHT, a right turn points DOWN) and then uses three \u201cMOVE\u201d actions to go down: (3,3) \u2192 (4,3) \u2192 (5,3) \u2192 (6,3).\n8. Finally, from (6,3) facing DOWN, a \u201cLEFT\u201d turn (from DOWN, left yields RIGHT) aligns the agent with the horizontal path to the GOAL, and three \u201cMOVE\u201d actions take the agent from (6,3) \u2192 (6,4) \u2192 (6,5) \u2192 (6,6).\n\nStanding on (6,6) with the GOAL completes the objective."}
