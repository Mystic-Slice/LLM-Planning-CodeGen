Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nUP\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n  [\"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nTo explain briefly:\n1. Starting at (4,1) facing UP, the agent turns RIGHT to face east.\n2. It moves from (4,1) to (4,2).\n3. It then turns RIGHT to face DOWN so that the KEY at (5,2) is directly in front.\n4. With the KEY in view, it performs PICKUP.\n5\u20136. Now holding the key, the agent needs to reach the door. From (4,2) facing DOWN, two LEFT turns reorient it to face UP.\n7\u20138. It moves upward from (4,2) to (3,2) and then to (2,2).\n9. At (2,2), it turns RIGHT so the door at (2,3) is directly in front.\n10. It uses UNLOCK to open the door.\n11. It moves into the door cell at (2,3).\n12\u201314. Proceeding in the unlocked room, the agent moves right through cells (2,4), (2,5), and (2,6).\n15. At (2,6), it turns RIGHT (from facing RIGHT to facing DOWN).\n16\u201319. Finally, it moves down from (2,6) step by step through (3,6), (4,6), (5,6) and reaches the GOAL at (6,6)."}
