Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nLEFT\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n[\"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. You start at (3,3) facing LEFT (i.e., West). The KEY is at (4,1), so one position from which you can pick it up is (4,2) facing WEST (so that the cell in front, (4,1), contains the KEY).\n\n2. Action \"MOVE\": From (3,3) facing WEST, you move to (3,2).\n\n3. Action \"LEFT\": Facing WEST, turning left rotates you 90\u00b0 to face DOWN (south).\n\n4. Action \"MOVE\": From (3,2) facing DOWN, you move to (4,2).\n\n5. Action \"RIGHT\": From (4,2) facing DOWN, turning right makes you face WEST.\n\n6. Action \"PICKUP\": Now at (4,2) facing WEST, the cell in front is (4,1) where the KEY is located; you pick it up.\n\n7. With the KEY in hand, you need to unlock the DOOR at (4,4). To do that, you must be adjacent with the door directly in front of you. A good position is (4,3) facing EAST.\n\n8. Actions \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\": From (4,2) facing WEST, two right turns (WEST\u2192NORTH\u2192EAST) make you face EAST.\n\n9. Action \"MOVE\": Move from (4,2) to (4,3).\n\n10. Action \"UNLOCK\": With the KEY in hand and now at (4,3) facing EAST, the cell in front (4,4) has the DOOR; you unlock it.\n\n11. Having unlocked the door, you now move through it. Action \"MOVE\": You move from (4,3) to (4,4).\n\n12. In the door room (the right room), the GOAL is at (6,6). From (4,4) (facing EAST), you want to eventually get to (6,6). First, move east:\n    - Action \"MOVE\": From (4,4) to (4,5).\n    - Action \"MOVE\": From (4,5) to (4,6).\n\n13. Now, you need to head south. Action \"RIGHT\": From facing EAST, turning right turns you to face SOUTH.\n\n14. Action \"MOVE\": From (4,6) facing SOUTH, move to (5,6).\n\n15. Action \"MOVE\": Finally, from (5,6) facing SOUTH, move to (6,6), where the GOAL is located.\n\nThis sequence meets the objective while following the movement and interaction rules of the environment."}
