Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nLEFT\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n[\"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nLet's explain the plan step-by-step:\n\n1. Starting at row 5, col 1 facing LEFT, we first need to face UP (since the KEY is located one cell north of row 3, col 1). A single \"RIGHT\" turn (from LEFT to UP) is used.\n2. \"MOVE\" from row 5, col 1 to row 4, col 1.\n3. \"MOVE\" from row 4, col 1 to row 3, col 1.\n4. With the agent at row 3, col 1 facing UP, the KEY is directly ahead (at row 2, col 1). Use \"PICKUP\" to grab the KEY.\n5. \"MOVE\" moves the agent from row 3, col 1 to row 2, col 1 (this cell becomes empty since the KEY has been picked up).\n6. To unlock the DOOR (located at row 2, col 2), the agent must now face EAST. From UP, a \"RIGHT\" turn makes the agent face EAST.\n7. From row 2, col 1 facing EAST, the DOOR is directly in front. Use \"UNLOCK\" to unlock it (with the KEY in hand).\n8. \"MOVE\" into the cell containing the once-locked DOOR (row 2, col 2).\n9. \"MOVE\" from row 2, col 2 into row 2, col 3 \u2013 this moves the agent from the left room into the right room.\n10. Now to head toward the GOAL (at row 6, col 6) in the right room, the agent must head DOWN. Given the agent is facing EAST, a \"RIGHT\" turn rotates the facing to SOUTH.\n11. \"MOVE\" from row 2, col 3 to row 3, col 3.\n12. \"MOVE\" from row 3, col 3 to row 4, col 3.\n13. \"MOVE\" from row 4, col 3 to row 5, col 3.\n14. \"MOVE\" from row 5, col 3 to row 6, col 3.\n15. At row 6, col 3 and facing SOUTH, the path to the GOAL (at row 6, col 6) is to the EAST. A \"LEFT\" turn from SOUTH rotates the agent to face EAST.\n16. \"MOVE\" from row 6, col 3 to row 6, col 4.\n17. \"MOVE\" from row 6, col 4 to row 6, col 5.\n18. \"MOVE\" from row 6, col 5 to row 6, col 6 where the GOAL is located.\n\nFollowing this sequence ensures that the agent picks up the KEY, unlocks the DOOR, crosses into the other room, and finally steps onto the GOAL."}
