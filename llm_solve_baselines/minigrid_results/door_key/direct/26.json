Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nRIGHT\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n    [\"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions> \n\nThe reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. Starting at (4,2) facing RIGHT, we want to pick up the KEY at (6,3) without stepping into its cell. First, we change direction to DOWN so we can go below the agent.  \n   - \"RIGHT\" turns the agent from facing RIGHT to facing DOWN.\n\n2. Moving DOWN from (4,2) we traverse from (4,2) to (5,2) then to (6,2).  \n   - \"MOVE\" \u2192 (5,2)  \n   - \"MOVE\" \u2192 (6,2)\n\n3. At (6,2), we need to be adjacent to the KEY (which is in (6,3)) and facing it. Since we are facing DOWN, we turn left to face RIGHT.  \n   - \"LEFT\"  \n\n4. Now, with the KEY directly in front at (6,3), we execute:  \n   - \"PICKUP\"\n\n5. With the KEY in hand, we now need to reach the door at (2,5) to unlock it. We choose to approach the door from the left (i.e. stand in (2,4) facing RIGHT). First, we face UP. From current facing RIGHT, turning left brings us to UP.  \n   - \"LEFT\"\n\n6. Moving UP from (6,2):  \n   - \"MOVE\" \u2192 (5,2)  \n   - \"MOVE\" \u2192 (4,2)  \n   - \"MOVE\" \u2192 (3,2)  \n   - \"MOVE\" \u2192 (2,2)\n\n7. At (2,2) and still facing UP, we turn RIGHT to face the door\u2019s direction:  \n   - \"RIGHT\"\n\n8. Then we move RIGHT to reach (2,3) and then (2,4):  \n   - \"MOVE\" \u2192 (2,3)  \n   - \"MOVE\" \u2192 (2,4)\n\n9. Now standing at (2,4) facing RIGHT, with the door (2,5) directly ahead, we unlock it (while holding the KEY):  \n   - \"UNLOCK\"\n\n10. With the door unlocked, we move through it. First, step into (2,5) then move further right to exit the room:  \n    - \"MOVE\" \u2192 (2,5)  \n    - \"MOVE\" \u2192 (2,6)\n\n11. The GOAL is in the other room at (6,6). From (2,6) facing RIGHT, we turn DOWN to head towards the goal:  \n    - \"RIGHT\"\n\n12. Finally, moving DOWN successively we go through (3,6), (4,6), (5,6) and end at (6,6) on the GOAL:  \n    - \"MOVE\" \u2192 (3,6)  \n    - \"MOVE\" \u2192 (4,6)  \n    - \"MOVE\" \u2192 (5,6)  \n    - \"MOVE\" \u2192 (6,6)\n\nThis sequence of 21 actions fulfills the objective of picking up the key, unlocking the door, and reaching the goal."}
