Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nUP\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n[\"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nExplanation:\n1. The agent starts at (3,1) facing UP. Two \"LEFT\" turns make the agent face DOWN.\n2. Three \"MOVE\" actions take the agent from (3,1) down to (6,1).\n3. A \"LEFT\" turn from DOWN makes the agent face RIGHT.\n4. A \"MOVE\" brings the agent from (6,1) to (6,2) so that the KEY at (6,3) lies directly ahead.\n5. \"PICKUP\" collects the KEY.\n6. A \"LEFT\" turn from RIGHT makes the agent face UP.\n7. Three \"MOVE\" actions move the agent upward from (6,2) to (3,2).\n8. A \"RIGHT\" turn makes the agent face RIGHT.\n9. Two \"MOVE\" actions bring the agent from (3,2) to (3,4), placing it immediately to the left of the DOOR at (3,5).\n10. \"UNLOCK\" unlocks the door (using the held KEY).\n11. A \"MOVE\" steps into the door cell, followed by another \"MOVE\" entering the target (right) room at (3,6).\n12. A final \"RIGHT\" turn (from RIGHT to DOWN) and three \"MOVE\" actions navigate the agent down from (3,6) to the GOAL at (6,6).\n\nThis sequence satisfies the objective of collecting the KEY in the starting (left) room, unlocking the door, and then moving into the room containing the GOAL."}
