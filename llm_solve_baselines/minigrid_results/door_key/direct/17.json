Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nDOWN\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions> \n\nHere's a breakdown of the solution:\n\n1. Starting at (6,2) facing DOWN, we first want to pick up the KEY at (5,1) without moving onto its cell (since objects block movement). We reorient:\n   - \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\": From DOWN to UP.\n   - \"MOVE\": Advance from (6,2) to (5,2).\n   - \"LEFT\": Turn from UP to face WEST so that the cell directly ahead is (5,1) where the KEY is.\n   - \"PICKUP\": Pick up the KEY.\n\n2. With the KEY in hand, we navigate from (5,2) to the door\u2019s adjacent cell:\n   - \"RIGHT\": From facing WEST, turn to face NORTH.\n   - \"MOVE\" x4: Moving NORTH up the left-room to reach (1,2) along the safe corridor.\n   - \"RIGHT\": Turn from NORTH to face EAST.\n   - \"MOVE\": Advance to (1,3) so that (1,4) (the DOOR cell) is directly in front.\n\n3. At (1,3) facing EAST, we proceed to unlock and pass through the door:\n   - \"UNLOCK\": Unlock the door at (1,4) using the KEY.\n   - \"MOVE\": Step into the door cell (1,4).\n   - \"MOVE\": Continue from (1,4) into (1,5) in the adjacent (right) room.\n\n4. Finally, in the second room the GOAL is at (6,6). We navigate to it:\n   - \"RIGHT\": From facing EAST at (1,5), turn to face SOUTH.\n   - \"MOVE\" x4: Move SOUTH from (1,5) through (2,5), (3,5), (4,5) until reaching (5,5).\n   - \"LEFT\": Turn from SOUTH to face EAST.\n   - \"MOVE\": Move from (5,5) to (5,6).\n   - \"RIGHT\": Turn from EAST to face SOUTH.\n   - \"MOVE\": Finally, move from (5,6) to (6,6), landing on the GOAL.\n\nThis sequence of actions satisfies the objective of picking the KEY, unlocking the DOOR, and reaching the GOAL."}
