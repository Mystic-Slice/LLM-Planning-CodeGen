Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nRIGHT\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n[\"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nExplanation:\n1. Starting at (4,2) facing RIGHT, the first two \"LEFT\" turns reorient you to face LEFT.\n2. \"MOVE\" takes you from (4,2) to (4,1).\n3. \"LEFT\" (from facing LEFT) makes you face SOUTH so that the KEY (at (5,1)) is in front.\n4. \"PICKUP\" grabs the KEY without moving you.\n5. Next, from (4,1) (facing SOUTH), another \"LEFT\" turns you to face EAST.\n6. Three \"MOVE\" commands (from (4,1) to (4,2), then to (4,3), then to (4,4)) bring you closer to the door\u2019s neighborhood.\n7. \"LEFT\" rotates you from EAST to NORTH so you can move upward.\n8. \"MOVE\" moves you from (4,4) to (3,4).\n9. \"RIGHT\" changes your orientation from NORTH to EAST, placing the DOOR at (3,5) directly in front.\n10. \"UNLOCK\" uses your KEY to unlock the DOOR.\n11. \"MOVE\" lets you step into the DOOR cell (from (3,4) to (3,5)).\n12. \"MOVE\" goes further to (3,6) in the right room.\n13. \"RIGHT\" rotates you from EAST to SOUTH to start heading toward the GOAL.\n14. Three \"MOVE\" actions (from (3,6) to (4,6), then to (5,6), and finally to (6,6)) bring you onto the GOAL.\n\nThis sequence meets the objectives: picking up the key, unlocking the door, and finally reaching the GOAL."}
