Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nUP\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n[\"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions> \n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. Starting at (4,1) facing UP, the key is at (1,1) which is directly above the agent but cannot be entered. So we move up without entering the key cell:\n   - \"MOVE\": from (4,1) to (3,1)\n   - \"MOVE\": from (3,1) to (2,1)\n\n2. Now, while at (2,1) facing UP, the cell in front (1,1) contains the KEY. \n   - \"PICKUP\": to pick up the key without moving into the cell.\n\n3. With the key in hand, we need to return to the door located at (4,2) so we can unlock it. From (2,1) facing UP, we turn to face DOWN:\n   - \"RIGHT\" then \"RIGHT\": now facing DOWN.\n   - \"MOVE\": from (2,1) to (3,1)\n   - \"MOVE\": from (3,1) to (4,1)\n\n4. The door is directly east of (4,1). Facing DOWN, we turn left to face RIGHT:\n   - \"LEFT\": now facing RIGHT.\n   - \"UNLOCK\": unlocks the door at (4,2) (since the door is directly in front and we\u2019re holding the key).\n\n5. Now we cross the door into the adjacent room (door cell becomes passable):\n   - \"MOVE\": from (4,1) into the door cell (4,2).\n\n6. In the second room the goal is at (6,6). We navigate right and then down:\n   - \"MOVE\": from (4,2) to (4,3)\n   - \"MOVE\": from (4,3) to (4,4)\n   - \"MOVE\": from (4,4) to (4,5)\n   - \"MOVE\": from (4,5) to (4,6)\n   - \"RIGHT\": turn right to face DOWN (from RIGHT).\n   - \"MOVE\": from (4,6) to (5,6)\n   - \"MOVE\": from (5,6) to (6,6), reaching the GOAL.\n    \nThis sequence of actions fulfills the objective of unlocking the door and reaching the GOAL in the other room."}
