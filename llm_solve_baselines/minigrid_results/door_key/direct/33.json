Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nLEFT\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n[\"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions> \n\nHere's the step\u2010by\u2010step explanation:\n\n1. Starting at (3,2) facing LEFT:\n   - \"RIGHT\": now facing UP.\n   - \"MOVE\": advances to (2,2).\n2. At (2,2) facing UP:\n   - \"RIGHT\": now facing RIGHT.\n   - \"MOVE\": goes to (2,3), which positions you so that the KEY at (2,4) is directly in front.\n   - \"PICKUP\": picks up the KEY from (2,4).\n3. Now with the KEY in hand (at (2,3) facing RIGHT), head toward the door at (5,5). Plan to approach the door from its left side (standing at (5,4) facing EAST):\n   - \"RIGHT\": from RIGHT, turning to face DOWN.\n   - \"MOVE\": from (2,3) to (3,3).\n   - \"MOVE\": from (3,3) to (4,3).\n   - \"LEFT\": facing DOWN turns to EAST.\n   - \"MOVE\": from (4,3) to (4,4).\n   - \"RIGHT\": facing EAST turns to DOWN.\n   - \"MOVE\": from (4,4) to (5,4).\n   - \"LEFT\": from DOWN, turning to face EAST (so the door at (5,5) is directly in front).\n4. With the KEY and in position:\n   - \"UNLOCK\": unlocks the door at (5,5).\n   - \"MOVE\": step into the unlocked door cell (5,5).\n5. Finally, proceed to the GOAL at (6,6):\n   - \"MOVE\": from (5,5) to (5,6) (still facing EAST).\n   - \"RIGHT\": from EAST, turning to face DOWN.\n   - \"MOVE\": from (5,6) to (6,6) to reach the GOAL.\n   \nThis sequence completes the objective."}
