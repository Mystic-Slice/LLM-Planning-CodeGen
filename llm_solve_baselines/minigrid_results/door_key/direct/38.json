Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nLEFT\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n[\"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions> \n\nHere's the reasoning behind each action:\n\n1. \"RIGHT\": Starting at (3,1) facing LEFT, turning RIGHT makes you face UP.\n2. \"MOVE\": Advance from (3,1) to (2,1). Now the cell in front (at (1,1)) contains the KEY.\n3. \"PICKUP\": While at (2,1) facing UP, pick up the KEY from (1,1).\n4. \"MOVE\": Now move UP from (2,1) to (1,1). (Since the KEY has been picked up, this cell is empty.)\n5. \"RIGHT\": Facing UP at (1,1), turn RIGHT to face EAST. Now the cell in front (at (1,2)) is the DOOR.\n6. \"UNLOCK\": With the KEY in hand, unlock the DOOR at (1,2).\n7. \"MOVE\": Step forward into the now unlocked DOOR cell at (1,2).\n8. \"MOVE\": From (1,2) (facing EAST), move to (1,3) which is inside the second room.\n9. \"RIGHT\": Turn RIGHT from EAST to face DOWN.\n10.\u201314. \"MOVE\" five times: Move down from (1,3) through (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3) and finally to (6,3).\n15. \"LEFT\": At (6,3) facing DOWN, turn LEFT to face EAST.\n16.\u201318. \"MOVE\" three times: Move east from (6,3) through (6,4), (6,5) and finally arrive at (6,6) where the GOAL is located.\n\nFollowing this sequence satisfies the task: picking up the KEY, unlocking the DOOR, and reaching the GOAL."}
