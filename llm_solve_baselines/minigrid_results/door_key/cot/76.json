Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nUP\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The agent begins at (3,3) facing UP. To reach the key at (2,1), the chosen approach is to position the agent at (2,2) so that the key lies directly to its left.\n\u2003\u2022 \"MOVE\": From (3,3) moving UP to (2,3).\n\u2003\u2022 \"LEFT\": Turn left (UP \u2192 LEFT).\n\u2003\u2022 \"MOVE\": From (2,3) moving LEFT to (2,2).\n\u2003\u2022 \"PICKUP\": With the key immediately to the left at (2,1), pick it up.\n\n2. After collecting the key, the agent must travel to the door at (3,4) in order to unlock it.\n\u2003\u2022 \"LEFT\": From (2,2) facing LEFT, turn left so as to face DOWN.\n\u2003\u2022 \"MOVE\": From (2,2) moving DOWN to (3,2).\n\u2003\u2022 \"LEFT\": Turn left (DOWN \u2192 EAST).\n\u2003\u2022 \"MOVE\": From (3,2) moving EAST to (3,3) (the cell adjacent to the door).\n\u2003\u2022 \"UNLOCK\": Facing EAST toward the door at (3,4) and holding the key, unlock the door.\n\u2003\u2022 \"MOVE\": Move EAST into the door cell (3,4), thus entering the room that contains the goal.\n\n3. Now in the door room, the agent needs to navigate to the goal located at (6,6).\n\u2003\u2022 \"MOVE\": From (3,4) (facing EAST) move to (3,5).\n\u2003\u2022 \"MOVE\": From (3,5) move to (3,6).\n\u2003\u2022 \"RIGHT\": At (3,6), turn right (EAST \u2192 SOUTH).\n\u2003\u2022 \"MOVE\": From (3,6) moving SOUTH to (4,6).\n\u2003\u2022 \"MOVE\": From (4,6) moving SOUTH to (5,6).\n\u2003\u2022 \"MOVE\": From (5,6) moving SOUTH to (6,6), which is where the goal is located.\n\nThese moves collectively satisfy the game\u2019s objectives."}
