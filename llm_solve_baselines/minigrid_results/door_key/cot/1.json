Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nUP\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n    [\"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. Starting at (6,1) facing UP, we move upward five times to reach (1,1):\n   - MOVE to (5,1)\n   - MOVE to (4,1)\n   - MOVE to (3,1)\n   - MOVE to (2,1)\n   - MOVE to (1,1)\n2. At (1,1) still facing UP, we turn RIGHT to face the cell (1,2) where the KEY lies.\n   - RIGHT\n3. With the KEY directly ahead at (1,2), we pick it up.\n   - PICKUP\n4. Now, still at (1,1) and facing RIGHT, we move into the cell (1,2).\n   - MOVE\n5. With the door immediately in front at (1,3), we unlock it using the KEY.\n   - UNLOCK\n6. After unlocking, we move into the now-unlocked door cell (1,3).\n   - MOVE\n7. Continuing in the right direction, we move into the right room by stepping from (1,3) to (1,4), then continue along the row:\n   - MOVE (to (1,4))\n   - MOVE (to (1,5))\n   - MOVE (to (1,6))\n8. At (1,6) still facing RIGHT, we turn RIGHT to face DOWN to head toward the GOAL.\n   - RIGHT\n9. Finally, we move down five times to go from row 1 to row 6, arriving at (6,6) where the GOAL is located:\n   - MOVE (to (2,6))\n   - MOVE (to (3,6))\n   - MOVE (to (4,6))\n   - MOVE (to (5,6))\n   - MOVE (to (6,6))\n\nThis sequence of actions will unlock the door and lead you to the goal."}
