Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nLEFT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n    [\"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. The agent starts at [5,2] facing LEFT. The KEY is at [5,3] to the right.  \n   \u2022 Two RIGHT turns (LEFT \u2192 UP then UP \u2192 RIGHT) make the agent face the KEY.  \n   \u2022 Then, PICKUP picks up the KEY from cell [5,3].\n\n2. With the KEY in hand, the agent must go to the DOOR at [3,5]. The door is reachable from the left room by approaching it from cell [3,4].  \n   \u2022 From [5,2] (facing RIGHT), two MOVE actions bring the agent to [5,3] and then [5,4].  \n   \u2022 From [5,4] (facing RIGHT), a LEFT turn makes the agent face UP.  \n   \u2022 Two MOVE actions then take the agent upward to [4,4] and then [3,4].\n\n3. Now at [3,4], with the door directly to the right at [3,5]:  \n   \u2022 A RIGHT turn (from UP) makes the agent face RIGHT.  \n   \u2022 The UNLOCK action unlocks the door (since the KEY is held).  \n   \u2022 A MOVE action brings the agent into the door\u2019s cell at [3,5].\n\n4. Now in the door room, the goal is at [6,6].  \n   \u2022 First, a MOVE action (while facing RIGHT) moves the agent to [3,6].  \n   \u2022 A RIGHT turn (from RIGHT) turns the agent to face DOWN.  \n   \u2022 Three MOVE actions then take the agent down from [3,6] \u2192 [4,6], then to [5,6], and finally to [6,6] where the GOAL is located.\n\nFollowing these steps produces the complete action list above."}
