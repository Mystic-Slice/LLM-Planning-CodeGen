Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nUP\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the reasoning step by step:\n\n1. Starting at (5,3) facing UP, we want to get near the KEY at (1,2) without entering its cell. We plan to stand at (2,2) and face UP so that the key at (1,2) is directly ahead.\n   - \"MOVE\": from (5,3) to (4,3) (facing UP).\n   - \"MOVE\": from (4,3) to (3,3) (facing UP).\n   - \"LEFT\": turn left to face LEFT.\n   - \"MOVE\": from (3,3) to (3,2) (facing LEFT).\n   - \"RIGHT\": turn right to face UP (since from LEFT, a RIGHT turn makes you face UP).\n   - \"MOVE\": from (3,2) to (2,2) (facing UP).\n\n2. With (1,2) directly in front, perform:\n   - \"PICKUP\": pick up the KEY.\n\n3. Now, with the key in hand, we want to head toward the DOOR at (5,5) which lies on the boundary between the left and right rooms. We plan to position ourselves in the left room at (5,4) facing RIGHT, so that DOOR is directly in front.\n   - From (2,2) facing UP, we need to go down:\n     - \"LEFT\": turn left (from UP to LEFT).\n     - \"LEFT\": turn left again (from LEFT to DOWN).\n     - \"MOVE\": from (2,2) to (3,2) (facing DOWN).\n     - \"MOVE\": from (3,2) to (4,2) (facing DOWN).\n     - \"MOVE\": from (4,2) to (5,2) (facing DOWN).\n   - Now, at (5,2) facing DOWN, we need to turn toward the right:\n     - \"LEFT\": turn left (from DOWN to RIGHT).\n     - \"MOVE\": from (5,2) to (5,3) (facing RIGHT).\n     - \"MOVE\": from (5,3) to (5,4) (facing RIGHT).\n\n4. With the KEY in hand and positioned at (5,4) facing RIGHT so that the DOOR at (5,5) is right ahead, perform:\n   - \"UNLOCK\": unlock the DOOR.\n\n5. Enter the door area and head to the GOAL:\n   - \"MOVE\": from (5,4) to (5,5) (entering the door cell).\n   - \"MOVE\": from (5,5) to (5,6) (still facing RIGHT, entering the right room).\n   - Now to get to the GOAL at (6,6), turn:\n     - \"RIGHT\": turn right (from RIGHT to face DOWN).\n   - \"MOVE\": from (5,6) to (6,6), landing on the GOAL.\n\nEach action follows the rules, ensuring that objects (like the KEY) aren\u2019t stepped on but are picked up from an adjacent position, and that the door is unlocked from the proper side before passing through. This completes the plan."}
