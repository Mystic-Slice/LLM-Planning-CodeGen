Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nLEFT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nLet's explain the plan step by step:\n\n1. Starting at (3,3) facing LEFT, a \"MOVE\" takes you to (3,2).  \n2. A \"LEFT\" turn from LEFT (west) makes you face DOWN (south).  \n3. \"MOVE\" from (3,2) while facing south sends you to (4,2).  \n4. Now, to pick up the KEY located at (4,1) (which is to the west of (4,2)), you need to face WEST. From DOWN, a \"RIGHT\" turn makes you face WEST.  \n5. \"PICKUP\" then collects the KEY from (4,1).  \n\nWith the KEY in hand, you now head toward the DOOR at (4,4):\n\n6. You are at (4,2) facing WEST. Two \"LEFT\" turns will reorient you: the first \"LEFT\" changes facing from WEST to SOUTH, and the second \"LEFT\" from SOUTH makes you face EAST.  \n7. \"MOVE\" from (4,2) facing EAST brings you to (4,3).  \n8. With the DOOR now directly in front (at (4,4)), use \"UNLOCK\" to open it (since you\u2019re holding the KEY).  \n9. \"MOVE\" advances you into the door cell (4,4).  \n\nNow that you\u2019re in the adjoining room and you need to reach the GOAL at (6,6):\n\n10. \"MOVE\" east from (4,4) to (4,5).  \n11. \"MOVE\" east from (4,5) to (4,6).  \n12. To head south, \"RIGHT\" (from east, a right turn points you to south).  \n13. \"MOVE\" south from (4,6) to (5,6).  \n14. \"MOVE\" south from (5,6) to (6,6), where the GOAL is located.\n\nThis complete sequence of actions unlocks the door and leads you successfully to the GOAL."}
