Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nUP\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n    [\"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Starting at (2,1) facing UP, we must first get to the KEY at (5,1) without stepping directly onto the KEY\u2019s cell. Since the KEY is located one cell below the cell (4,1), we plan to stand at (4,1) facing DOWN.\n\n2. At (2,1) (facing UP), we turn RIGHT then RIGHT to face DOWN. (Actions: \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\")\n\n3. MOVE forward twice along column 1:\n   - First MOVE: from (2,1) to (3,1)\n   - Second MOVE: from (3,1) to (4,1)\n   (Actions: \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\")\n\n4. Now standing at (4,1) facing DOWN, the cell directly in front (cell (5,1)) contains the KEY. We perform \"PICKUP\" to get the key.\n\n5. Next, we must unlock the DOOR at (3,2). The door is accessible from (3,1), with the door to the right of that cell. So we need to return from (4,1) to (3,1) and face RIGHT.\n   - While at (4,1) facing DOWN, we turn LEFT then LEFT to effectively face UP.\n   (Actions: \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\")\n   - MOVE forward from (4,1) to (3,1).\n   (Action: \"MOVE\")\n   - Now, from (3,1) facing UP, we turn RIGHT to face RIGHT.\n   (Action: \"RIGHT\")\n\n6. With the KEY in hand and now at (3,1) facing RIGHT (with the DOOR at (3,2) directly ahead), we perform \"UNLOCK\" to unlock the door.\n   (Action: \"UNLOCK\")\n\n7. After unlocking, we need to actually move through the open door into the next room. From (3,1) facing RIGHT, we MOVE:\n   - MOVE into (3,2) (the door cell)\n   - Then MOVE consecutively from (3,2) to (3,3), (3,3) to (3,4), (3,4) to (3,5), and (3,5) to (3,6). (Actions: five \"MOVE\" commands)\n\n8. At (3,6) still facing RIGHT, we now need to head toward the GOAL at (6,6) which is directly below. We turn RIGHT to face DOWN.\n   (Action: \"RIGHT\")\n   \n9. Finally, we MOVE three times downward:\n   - MOVE from (3,6) to (4,6)\n   - MOVE from (4,6) to (5,6)\n   - MOVE from (5,6) to (6,6)\n   (Actions: \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\")\n\nThis complete sequence ensures the KEY is picked up, the DOOR is unlocked, and the agent reaches the GOAL."}
