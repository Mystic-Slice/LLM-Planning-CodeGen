Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nRIGHT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Starting at [2,1] facing RIGHT, we want to get the key at [5,1] which is in the cell exactly below the key cell when standing at [4,1].  \n   \u2022 Action \"RIGHT\" turns the agent from facing RIGHT to facing DOWN.\n  \n2. Now facing DOWN, we \u201cMOVE\u201d from [2,1] to [3,1].\n3. Then \u201cMOVE\u201d from [3,1] to [4,1]. From here, the KEY is one cell down at [5,1].\n\n4. With the key cell directly ahead, \"PICKUP\" collects the KEY (note that you must be adjacent to pick up an object).\n\n5. Next we need to unlock the DOOR, which is at [4,2]. Currently, the agent is at [4,1] facing DOWN.  \n   \u2022 Action \"LEFT\" rotates the agent from DOWN to RIGHT so that the door cell [4,2] is now in front of the agent.\n\n6. With the DOOR directly ahead and holding the KEY, \"UNLOCK\" unlocks the door at [4,2].\n\n7. \"MOVE\" allows the agent to step into the door cell [4,2]. Now the agent is in the second room.\n\n8. In the second room, our GOAL is located at [6,6]. From the current position [4,2] facing RIGHT, we plan to traverse along the row.  \n   \u2022 \"MOVE\" steps into [4,3].\n   \u2022 \"MOVE\" steps into [4,4].\n   \u2022 \"MOVE\" steps into [4,5].\n   \u2022 \"MOVE\" steps into [4,6].\n\n9. Now at [4,6], to get closer to the goal (which is down at [6,6]), we change direction.  \n   \u2022 \"RIGHT\" turns the agent from RIGHT to face DOWN.\n\n10. Finally, we \"MOVE\" down from [4,6] to [5,6] and then \"MOVE\" again to reach the GOAL at [6,6].\n\nThe final output is the list of actions enclosed in <actions> tags as shown above."}
