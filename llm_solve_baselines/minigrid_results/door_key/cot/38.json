Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nLEFT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n    [\"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions> \n\nLet's explain our reasoning step by step:\n\n1. Starting at [3,1] facing LEFT, we want to get the key located at [1,1]. The key is directly north of [2,1]. So, we first turn RIGHT from LEFT to face UP.\n2. With the agent now facing UP, a MOVE takes us from [3,1] to [2,1]. Standing here, the cell in front ([1,1]) has the KEY.\n3. We then PICKUP the key from [1,1] (the cell directly ahead of our [2,1] position).\n4. With the key in hand, we still need to be adjacent to the door to unlock it. The door is located at [1,2] so one of its adjacent cells is [1,1]. We MOVE one step (UP) from [2,1] into [1,1].\n5. Now at [1,1] and holding the key, we need to face the door which is to our RIGHT. So we turn RIGHT.\n6. With the door now directly in front, we UNLOCK it.\n7. Now that the door (at [1,2]) is unlocked, we MOVE into that cell.\n8\u201311. From [1,2] (facing RIGHT) we continue moving east by doing four successive MOVEs to reach [1,6]. (Moves: from [1,2] \u2192 [1,3], then to [1,4], [1,5], and finally [1,6].)\n12. Next, we must head to the goal located at [6,6]. At [1,6] we turn RIGHT to face DOWN.\n13\u201317. Finally, we move down five times (from [1,6] \u2192 [2,6] \u2192 [3,6] \u2192 [4,6] \u2192 [5,6] \u2192 [6,6]). Arriving at [6,6], where the GOAL is located, the task is complete.\n\nThis sequence of actions follows the rules and leads the agent to pick up the KEY, unlock the DOOR, and finally reach the GOAL."}
