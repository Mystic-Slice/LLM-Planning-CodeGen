Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nLEFT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the step\u2010by\u2010step reasoning:\n\n1. Start at (2,1) facing LEFT. The KEY is at (1,1), directly above.\n2. \"RIGHT\" rotates your facing from LEFT to UP.\n3. \"PICKUP\" grabs the KEY from (1,1) (directly in front of you).\n4. With the key in hand, you need to reach the DOOR at (3,2). To do that, you want to stand at (3,1) so that the door is immediately to your right. Since you are at (2,1) (after picking up the key you haven\u2019t moved), turn to face DOWN.\n5. Two \"LEFT\" actions from UP will change your direction to LEFT then to DOWN (alternatively you could use two RIGHT turns). So \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\" instead.\n6. \"MOVE\" takes you from (2,1) to (3,1).\n7. From (3,1) facing DOWN, \"LEFT\" rotates you to the RIGHT (east), which points directly at the DOOR at (3,2).\n8. \"UNLOCK\" uses your key to unlock the DOOR immediately in front.\n9. \"MOVE\" advances you through the DOOR into cell (3,2).\n10. Now in the new room and facing east, you need to reach the GOAL at (6,6). Moving east along row 3 lets you approach the corridor. Four \"MOVE\" actions take you through cells (3,3), (3,4), (3,5), and (3,6).\n11. At (3,6) facing east, \"RIGHT\" turns you to face DOWN.\n12. Finally, three \"MOVE\" actions carry you from (3,6) to (4,6), then (5,6), and finally (6,6), where the GOAL is located.\n\nThis sequence completes the objective. Enjoy your game!"}
