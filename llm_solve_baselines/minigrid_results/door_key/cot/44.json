Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nDOWN\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nLet's explain the reasoning step by step:\n\n1. From the starting cell at (5,1) facing DOWN we first turn LEFT so that we face RIGHT.  \n2. We MOVE twice to reach (5,3) (moving from (5,1)\u2192(5,2) then (5,2)\u2192(5,3)).  \n3. Then we turn LEFT to face UP. From (5,3), the cell directly in front, (4,3), contains the KEY.  \n4. WeIssue PICKUP to grab the key. (Note: We never step into the KEY cell, as per the rules you must pick it up from an adjacent cell.)  \n5. After securing the key, we head to the DOOR at (1,4). We do so by moving UP from (5,3): first MOVE from (5,3)\u2192(4,3), then from (4,3)\u2192(3,3), then (3,3)\u2192(2,3), and finally (2,3)\u2192(1,3).  \n6. At (1,3) we are adjacent to the door (the DOOR is at (1,4)). Since we are facing UP, we turn RIGHT to face the door.  \n7. We then use UNLOCK to open the door while holding the key.  \n8. Next, we MOVE into the door cell (from (1,3)\u2192(1,4)).  \n9. Now that we are in the second room, we plan the route to the GOAL located at (6,6). From (1,4) we MOVE right twice to position (1,6).  \n10. Facing RIGHT, we turn RIGHT to face DOWN.  \n11. Finally, we MOVE down step-by-step from row1 to row6 in column6: going from (1,6)\u2192(2,6), (2,6)\u2192(3,6), (3,6)\u2192(4,6), (4,6)\u2192(5,6) and then (5,6)\u2192(6,6) where the GOAL is located.\n\nThis sequence of actions correctly navigates the agent from the starting room, picks up the key, unlocks the door, and reaches the GOAL in the other room."}
