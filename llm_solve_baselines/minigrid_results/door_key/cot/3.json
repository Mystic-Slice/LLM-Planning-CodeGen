Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nUP\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions> \n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n1. Starting at (1,1) facing UP, the agent turns RIGHT to face EAST.\n2. A MOVE brings the agent to (1,2) while facing EAST.\n3. To head downward (toward the KEY at (4,2)), the agent turns RIGHT; now facing SOUTH.\n4. A MOVE takes the agent from (1,2) to (2,2).\n5. Another MOVE brings the agent to (3,2). Now, the KEY is directly in front at (4,2).\n6. The agent executes PICKUP to collect the KEY.\n7. With the KEY in hand, the agent needs to reach the door at (5,5). From (3,2) (facing SOUTH), a LEFT turn reorients the agent EAST.\n8. MOVE to (3,3).\n9. MOVE to (3,4).\n10. To head south towards the door, the agent turns RIGHT (from EAST to SOUTH).\n11. MOVE to (4,4).\n12. MOVE to (5,4); this positions the agent immediately west of the door.\n13. A LEFT turn (from SOUTH to EAST) makes the door (at (5,5)) directly in front.\n14. The agent then uses UNLOCK (with the KEY) to unlock the door.\n15. MOVE into the door cell at (5,5).\n16. In the right room, a MOVE from (5,5) to (5,6) along the EAST brings the agent closer to the GOAL.\n17. The agent turns RIGHT (from EAST to SOUTH) to face the GOAL.\n18. Finally, a MOVE from (5,6) to (6,6) places the agent on the GOAL cell, completing the objective.\n"}
