Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nDOWN\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nLet's break down the plan step by step:\n\n1. You start at [1,1] facing DOWN. The key is at [5,1], but you cannot enter a cell that already contains an object. Instead, you must stand one cell away (at [4,1]) and then perform a PICKUP.\n2. Actions \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\" move you from [1,1] to [2,1], then to [3,1], and finally to [4,1].\n3. At [4,1] facing DOWN, the cell in front ([5,1]) contains the KEY. You perform \"PICKUP\" to grab it.\n4. Now holding the key, you MOVE into the key\u2019s former cell at [5,1].\n5. The DOOR is at [5,2] (to your right when you are at [5,1]). Since you are facing DOWN, turning \"LEFT\" from DOWN reorients you EAST.\n6. With the door now directly in front, you perform \"UNLOCK\" to open it.\n7. Now, you \"MOVE\" into the door cell ([5,2]). From here you are in the room that leads to the GOAL.\n8. You then use successive \"MOVE\" actions to travel east along row 5 from [5,2] to [5,3], then [5,4], then [5,5], and finally to [5,6].\n9. Finally, since the GOAL is at [6,6] (directly south of [5,6]), you execute a \"RIGHT\" turn from your current eastward direction (as turning right while facing east makes you face south), and then \"MOVE\" to step onto the GOAL cell.\n\nThis sequence allows you to pick up the key, unlock the door, navigate through the door and finally reach the goal."}
