Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nLEFT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nLet's walk through the reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The agent starts at position (2,1) facing LEFT. The KEY is located at (6,1) (in the left room) and the DOOR is at (5,2). Since you cannot move into a cell with an object (like the KEY), the agent must pick it up while standing in an adjacent cell. Standing at (5,1) and facing DOWN allows the agent to pick up the KEY at (6,1).\n\n2. From the starting orientation (LEFT), a single \"LEFT\" action rotates the agent from facing LEFT to facing DOWN. Then three \"MOVE\" actions take the agent from:\n   - (2,1) \u2192 (3,1)\n   - (3,1) \u2192 (4,1)\n   - (4,1) \u2192 (5,1)\n\n3. Now at (5,1) and still facing DOWN, the cell in front (6,1) contains the KEY. The \"PICKUP\" action collects the key.\n\n4. With the key in hand, the agent needs to unlock the DOOR at (5,2), which is immediately to the EAST of (5,1). From facing DOWN, turning \"LEFT\" will reorient the agent to face EAST. The \"UNLOCK\" action then unlocks the door (since the door is directly in front).\n\n5. With the door unlocked, the agent \"MOVE\"s into the door cell at (5,2) and then continues moving EAST through the now-accessible room. Four additional \"MOVE\" actions navigate the agent:\n   - (5,2) \u2192 (5,3)\n   - (5,3) \u2192 (5,4)\n   - (5,4) \u2192 (5,5)\n   - (5,5) \u2192 (5,6)\n\n6. The GOAL is in the adjacent cell (6,6) (i.e., one step DOWN from (5,6)). From facing EAST, a \"RIGHT\" turn makes the agent face DOWN. Finally, one \"MOVE\" brings the agent from (5,6) to (6,6) to complete the game.\n\nThus, the full sequence is as provided above. Enjoy your game!"}
