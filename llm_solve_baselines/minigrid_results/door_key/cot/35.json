Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nUP\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nLet's explain the reasoning step by step:\n\n1. Starting at (1,1) facing UP, the KEY is located at (2,1) (directly below). To have the KEY in your front, you must face DOWN. You can do that by turning 90\u00b0 RIGHT twice.\n2. With the orientation now DOWN, execute PICKUP so that the KEY in cell (2,1) is acquired.\n3. Now, the DOOR is located at (1,2) to your east. To face east from your current DOWN orientation, turn 90\u00b0 LEFT.\n4. With the KEY and facing EAST, perform UNLOCK to unlock the DOOR (located at (1,2), directly in front).\n5. Next, MOVE so you step into the door cell. Now you\u2019re effectively at the connecting door cell.\n6. To ensure you are safely into the second room (the room that contains the GOAL), MOVE again from the door cell into the room beyond (from (1,2) to (1,3)).\n7. The GOAL is at (6,6) further inside the second room. From (1,3) (still facing EAST), turn RIGHT to face DOWN.\n8. Now, MOVE 5 times to go down from (1,3) to (6,3).\n9. At (6,3), you need to head east to reach (6,6). From the current SOUTH-facing orientation, turn LEFT to be facing EAST.\n10. Finally, MOVE 3 times to go right from (6,3) to (6,6) and step onto the GOAL.\n\nThis sequence of 17 actions achieves the objective."}
