Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nRIGHT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Starting at (5,1) facing RIGHT, we first turn LEFT so that we face UP.\n2. We then MOVE four times to go from (5,1) up to (1,1):\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 (5,1) \u2013> (4,1)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 (4,1) \u2013> (3,1)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 (3,1) \u2013> (2,1)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 (2,1) \u2013> (1,1)\n3. At (1,1) we turn RIGHT (from UP to RIGHT) so that the cell in front, (1,2), is where the KEY is.\n4. We perform PICKUP to get the key (from cell (1,2)).\n5. Now with the key in hand and still at (1,1) facing RIGHT, we move toward the door. We choose a path that goes along row 1 and then downward:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 MOVE from (1,1) to (1,2)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 MOVE from (1,2) to (1,3)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 MOVE from (1,3) to (1,4)\n6. At (1,4) still facing RIGHT, we turn RIGHT so that our facing becomes DOWN.\n7. We then MOVE down four times to go from (1,4) to (5,4):\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 (1,4) \u2013> (2,4)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 (2,4) \u2013> (3,4)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 (3,4) \u2013> (4,4)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 (4,4) \u2013> (5,4)\n8. At (5,4) we are facing DOWN but we need to face RIGHT so that the DOOR at (5,5) is directly in front. We turn LEFT (from DOWN, left turn makes us face RIGHT).\n9. Now, while at (5,4) facing RIGHT, we UNLOCK the door located at (5,5) (using our key).\n10. Once the door is unlocked, we MOVE:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 MOVE into (5,5) (the door cell, now unlocked)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 MOVE into (5,6)\n11. At (5,6) still facing RIGHT, we turn RIGHT so that we face DOWN (since the GOAL is located at (6,6)).\n12. Finally, we MOVE from (5,6) to (6,6) to reach the GOAL.\n\nThis sequence of 21 actions achieves the objectives in the provided grid."}
