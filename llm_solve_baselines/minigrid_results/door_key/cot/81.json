Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nLEFT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "Let's break down the solution:\n\n1. Our agent starts at [3,1] facing LEFT. The KEY is at [1,1]. Since our agent can only pick up objects from the cell directly in front, we must approach the KEY from a neighboring cell rather than stepping into its cell.\n\n2. To pick up the KEY:\n   \u2022 From [3,1] facing LEFT, we first need to face UP to head toward [1,1]. A RIGHT turn (when facing LEFT) changes our facing direction to UP.\n   \u2022 Then, a MOVE brings us from [3,1] to [2,1].\n   \u2022 At [2,1] and facing UP, the cell in front ([1,1]) holds the KEY. We now issue a PICKUP so that the key is collected.\n   \n3. Next, to unlock the DOOR:\n   \u2022 The DOOR is at [1,2]. To unlock it, it must be directly in front of us. From our current cell [2,1] (with the KEY now in our inventory), we move UP into [1,1] (which is now empty after picking up the KEY).\n   \u2022 At [1,1] we are still facing UP. We now want the DOOR ([1,2]) to be in front, so we turn RIGHT (from UP to RIGHT).\n   \u2022 With the DOOR directly ahead, we issue an UNLOCK command.\n   \n4. Now we must traverse to the GOAL, which is at [6,6] in the other room:\n   \u2022 After unlocking, still at [1,1] and facing RIGHT, we MOVE into the door cell at [1,2].\n   \u2022 We need to fully step into the right room. So we MOVE again from [1,2] to [1,3].\n   \u2022 Now, we turn RIGHT to face DOWN (from RIGHT, a RIGHT turn gives us DOWN) so we can head to the lower part of the room.\n   \u2022 We then move DOWN successively:\n       - From [1,3] to [2,3]\n       - [2,3] to [3,3]\n       - [3,3] to [4,3]\n       - [4,3] to [5,3]\n       - [5,3] to [6,3]\n   \u2022 At [6,3] facing DOWN, we now need to move rightwards to col6 where the GOAL resides. From DOWN, a LEFT turn directs us to the RIGHT.\n   \u2022 Finally, we move RIGHT three times:\n       - [6,3] to [6,4]\n       - [6,4] to [6,5]\n       - [6,5] to [6,6] (GOAL)\n\nHere is the list of actions in order:\n\n<actions>\n[\"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>"}
