Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nLEFT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "We can solve the problem by \u201cwalking\u201d through the grid step\u2010by\u2010step. (Remember that the agent can only pick up or unlock objects from the cell directly in front of it, and that you cannot move into a cell that contains an object until you\u2019ve picked it up.) In our sample grid, the KEY is in the left room at [4,1] (with rows counted from 0) and the locked DOOR is at [2,4] (which is the barrier between the left room and the right room, where the GOAL is located at [6,6]). Our starting position is [1,2] (since that cell contains \u201cAGENT\u201d) and the agent is initially facing LEFT.\n\nBelow is one correct way to solve the puzzle:\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1.\u2003We start at [1,2] facing LEFT. Moving forward goes one cell left into [1,1].\n\u2003\u2003Action: MOVE\n\n2.\u2003Now at [1,1] and still facing LEFT. The KEY is in cell [4,1], i.e. directly below our current (column 1 remains the same, row increases). To face down, we turn left (turning left while facing LEFT rotates the agent to face DOWN).\n\u2003\u2003Action: LEFT\n\n3.\u2003With the agent now facing DOWN at [1,1], MOVE takes us to [2,1].\n\u2003\u2003Action: MOVE\n\n4.\u2003Continuing DOWN from [2,1] gets us to [3,1].\n\u2003\u2003Action: MOVE\n\n5.\u2003Looking ahead from [3,1] (facing DOWN), the adjacent cell [4,1] contains our KEY. So we pick it up.\n\u2003\u2003Action: PICKUP\n\n6.\u2003Now holding the KEY, we need to go to the door. We plan to approach the door so that we stand just to its left. The door is at [2,4] so the \u201cleft-adjacent cell\u201d is [2,3]. We are currently at [3,1]. To head toward [2,3], first we change direction to head RIGHT. (When facing DOWN, turning LEFT rotates the agent to face RIGHT.)\n\u2003\u2003Action: LEFT\n\n7.\u2003Now facing RIGHT at [3,1]. MOVing right takes us to [3,2].\n\u2003\u2003Action: MOVE\n\n8.\u2003From [3,2] facing RIGHT, moving again brings us to [3,3].\n\u2003\u2003Action: MOVE\n\n9.\u2003We now need to move upward (north) one row to reach [2,3]. However, we must also ensure we end up facing RIGHT (since the door at [2,4] must be directly in front of us when unlocking it). At [3,3] the agent is facing RIGHT; a LEFT turn will change that orientation from RIGHT to UP.\n\u2003\u2003Action: LEFT\n\n10.\u2003Now facing UP at [3,3]; a MOVE takes us \u201cup\u201d into [2,3].\n\u2003\u2003Action: MOVE\n\n11.\u2003At [2,3] we must now face RIGHT. With the agent currently facing UP, a RIGHT turn will rotate it to face RIGHT.\n\u2003\u2003Action: RIGHT\n\n12.\u2003Standing at [2,3] and facing RIGHT, the door in cell [2,4] is directly in front. With the KEY in hand, we now unlock the door.\n\u2003\u2003Action: UNLOCK\n\n13.\u2003After unlocking, the door cell becomes passable. We now MOVE into [2,4] (the now-unlocked door cell).\n\u2003\u2003Action: MOVE\n\n14.\u2003With the door behind us, we are in the right room. The GOAL is at [6,6]. At [2,4] and still facing RIGHT, a MOVE will take us to [2,5].\n\u2003\u2003Action: MOVE\n\n15.\u2003At [2,5] facing RIGHT, we want to begin traveling downward to reach the row where the GOAL lies. To face DOWN from RIGHT, we turn RIGHT.\n\u2003\u2003Action: RIGHT\n\n16.\u2003From [2,5] facing DOWN, a MOVE goes to [3,5].\n\u2003\u2003Action: MOVE\n\n17.\u2003Keep moving DOWN: from [3,5] we MOVE into [4,5].\n\u2003\u2003Action: MOVE\n\n18.\u2003Another MOVE from [4,5] (facing DOWN) brings us to [5,5].\n\u2003\u2003Action: MOVE\n\n19.\u2003One more MOVE DOWN: from [5,5] we get to [6,5].\n\u2003\u2003Action: MOVE\n\n20.\u2003Now at [6,5] facing DOWN, we need to be facing RIGHT so that the final MOVE brings us into the cell [6,6] (which contains the GOAL). When facing DOWN, a LEFT turn rotates the agent to face RIGHT.\n\u2003\u2003Action: LEFT\n\n21.\u2003Finally, MOVE from [6,5] facing RIGHT leads directly into [6,6] where the GOAL is located.\n\u2003\u2003Action: MOVE\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nThus, the list of actions (in order) is:\n\nMOVE, LEFT, MOVE, MOVE, PICKUP, LEFT, MOVE, MOVE, LEFT, MOVE, RIGHT, UNLOCK, MOVE, MOVE, RIGHT, MOVE, MOVE, MOVE, MOVE, LEFT, MOVE\n\nBelow is the answer wrapped in the required XML tags.\n\n<actions>\n[\"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>"}
