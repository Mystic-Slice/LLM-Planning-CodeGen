Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nRIGHT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nLet's explain the plan step by step:\n\n1. Starting at (4,2) facing RIGHT:\n   - \"MOVE\": Advance to (4,3).\n\n2. Now still in the left room, to head toward the KEY at (6,3):\n   - \"RIGHT\": Turn from RIGHT to face DOWN.\n   - \"MOVE\": Step from (4,3) to (5,3).\n\n3. Positioning to pick up the key (which is in the cell below at (6,3)):\n   - \"PICKUP\": With the agent at (5,3) facing DOWN, the key in (6,3) is picked up.\n\n4. With the key in hand, navigate toward a position adjacent to the DOOR at (2,5). A good cell is (2,4) so that when facing RIGHT the door is directly in front.\n   - \"LEFT\": From facing DOWN, turn left to face RIGHT.\n   - \"MOVE\": Move from (5,3) to (5,4).\n\n5. Now, head north from (5,4) (key held) to get to row 2:\n   - \"LEFT\": Turn from RIGHT to face UP (north).\n   - \"MOVE\": From (5,4) to (4,4).\n   - \"MOVE\": From (4,4) to (3,4).\n   - \"MOVE\": From (3,4) to (2,4).\n\n6. Set up to unlock the door:\n   - \"RIGHT\": Turn from UP to face RIGHT (so that the door at (2,5) is directly ahead).\n   - \"UNLOCK\": Unlock the door using the KEY (the door is at (2,5)).\n\n7. Cross through the door into the right room:\n   - \"MOVE\": Move from (2,4) into the door cell (2,5).\n   - \"MOVE\": Proceed from (2,5) to (2,6) in the right room.\n\n8. Now navigate to the GOAL at (6,6):\n   - \"RIGHT\": From facing RIGHT, turn RIGHT to face DOWN.\n   - \"MOVE\": From (2,6) to (3,6).\n   - \"MOVE\": From (3,6) to (4,6).\n   - \"MOVE\": From (4,6) to (5,6).\n   - \"MOVE\": From (5,6) to (6,6) \u2013 reaching the GOAL.\n\nThis sequence of actions fulfills the objective: picking up the key, unlocking the door, and arriving at the goal."}
