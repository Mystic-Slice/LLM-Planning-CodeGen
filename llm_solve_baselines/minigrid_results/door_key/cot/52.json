Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nLEFT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n1. Starting at (2,3) facing LEFT.\n2. \"LEFT\": Turn left from LEFT to face DOWN.\n3. Four \"MOVE\" actions: move from (2,3) \u2192 (3,3) \u2192 (4,3) \u2192 (5,3) \u2192 (6,3). Now you are in the row of the KEY.\n4. \"RIGHT\": Turn from DOWN to face LEFT (west). Now the cell in front, (6,2), contains the KEY.\n5. \"PICKUP\": Pick up the KEY.\n6. \"RIGHT\": With the KEY in hand and still at (6,3) (and originally facing LEFT), turn RIGHT so you now face NORTH.\n7. Three \"MOVE\" actions: move north from (6,3) \u2192 (5,3) \u2192 (4,3) \u2192 (3,3).\n8. \"RIGHT\": Turn from NORTH to face EAST. Now you are at (3,3) facing (3,4) and the door cell (3,5) is directly in front of that adjacent cell.\n9. \"MOVE\": Step into (3,4), which is immediately before the DOOR.\n10. \"UNLOCK\": With the KEY and facing the door at (3,5), unlock it.\n11. \"MOVE\": Step forward through the unlocked DOOR into cell (3,5).\n12. \"MOVE\": Continue moving from (3,5) to (3,6) in the connected room.\n13. \"RIGHT\": Turn from EAST to face SOUTH.\n14. Three \"MOVE\" actions: move south from (3,6) \u2192 (4,6) \u2192 (5,6) \u2192 (6,6), reaching the GOAL.\n\nFollowing these actions in order should achieve your objective."}
