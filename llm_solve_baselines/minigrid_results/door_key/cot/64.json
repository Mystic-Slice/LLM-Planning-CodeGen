Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nLEFT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n    [\"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions> \n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n1. Starting at (6,3) facing LEFT, we want to get near the KEY at (4,1). We plan to approach cell (4,2) so that by facing left we can pick up the key.\n   - \"MOVE\": From (6,3) to (6,2) (still facing LEFT).\n   - \"RIGHT\": Turn from LEFT to UP.\n   - \"MOVE\": Move from (6,2) upward to (5,2).\n   - \"MOVE\": Move from (5,2) upward to (4,2).\n   - \"LEFT\": Turn from UP to LEFT.\n   - \"PICKUP\": With the cell in front, (4,1), containing the KEY, pick it up.\n2. With the key in hand, next head to the door at (2,4). We aim to stand at (2,3) facing RIGHT so that the door (to our right) is immediately in front.\n   - \"RIGHT\": From facing LEFT turn to UP.\n   - \"MOVE\": From (4,2) to (3,2) moving upward.\n   - \"MOVE\": From (3,2) to (2,2) continuing upward.\n   - \"RIGHT\": From UP turn to RIGHT.\n   - \"MOVE\": Move from (2,2) to (2,3), now facing RIGHT.\n   - \"UNLOCK\": Unlock the door located in the cell immediately in front (at (2,4)).\n3. After unlocking, proceed through the door into the right room to reach the GOAL at (6,6).\n   - \"MOVE\": Step through the door from (2,3) to (2,4).\n   - \"MOVE\": From (2,4) to (2,5) moving right.\n   - \"MOVE\": From (2,5) to (2,6) still moving right.\n   - \"RIGHT\": Turn from RIGHT to DOWN.\n   - \"MOVE\": From (2,6) to (3,6) moving down.\n   - \"MOVE\": From (3,6) to (4,6) moving down.\n   - \"MOVE\": From (4,6) to (5,6) moving down.\n   - \"MOVE\": From (5,6) to (6,6), arriving at the GOAL.\n   \nThis sequence ensures that you collect the KEY, unlock the DOOR, and finally reach the GOAL."}
