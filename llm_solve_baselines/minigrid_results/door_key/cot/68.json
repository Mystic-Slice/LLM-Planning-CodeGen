Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nUP\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n    [\"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nLet's explain step by step:\n\n1. Starting at (4,1) facing UP, we first turn RIGHT so that we face east.\n2. We MOVE from (4,1) to (4,2).\n3. Then we turn RIGHT to face DOWN. Now the cell immediately in front (at (5,2)) contains the KEY.\n4. We execute PICKUP to grab the KEY.\n5\u20136. With the key in hand and currently at (4,2) facing DOWN, we need to travel to the door. The door is located at (2,3) and is best approached from the west, meaning from (2,2). To head upward, we turn LEFT twice (from DOWN \u2192 RIGHT then RIGHT \u2192 UP).\n7\u20138. We MOVE twice to go from (4,2) upward: first to (3,2) then to (2,2).\n9. At (2,2) facing UP, we turn RIGHT to face east where the door at (2,3) is.\n10. We then execute UNLOCK to open the door.\n11\u201312. With the door unlocked, we MOVE forward: first entering the door cell (2,3) and then stepping into the right-side room at (2,4).\n13. In the right room at (2,4) and still facing east, we turn RIGHT to face DOWN so we can navigate toward the goal.\n14\u201317. We MOVe downward four times, going from (2,4) \u2192 (3,4) \u2192 (4,4) \u2192 (5,4) \u2192 (6,4).\n18. At (6,4) facing DOWN, we turn LEFT to face RIGHT.\n19\u201320. Finally, we MOVE two times to reach (6,5) then (6,6), which is where the GOAL is located.\n\nThis sequence fulfills the objective: picking up the KEY, unlocking the DOOR, and reaching the GOAL."}
