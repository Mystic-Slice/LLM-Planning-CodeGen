Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nRIGHT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n    [\"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the step\u2010by\u2010step reasoning:\n\n1. Start at (3,1) facing RIGHT.\n2. \"MOVE\": Step from (3,1) to (3,2).\n3. \"RIGHT\": Turn right to face DOWN.\n4. \"MOVE\": From (3,2) move down to (4,2). Now, with the agent facing DOWN, the cell in front [(5,2)] contains the KEY.\n5. \"PICKUP\": Pick up the KEY from cell (5,2) without stepping into it.\n6. \"MOVE\": Move forward from (4,2) to (5,2) (the cell becomes empty after picking up the KEY).\n7. \"LEFT\": Turn left (from facing DOWN to face RIGHT). This will point to cell (5,3).\n8. \"MOVE\": Move from (5,2) to (5,3). Here the door lies immediately to the right.\n9. \"UNLOCK\": With the KEY in hand, unlock the DOOR in cell (5,4).\n10. \"MOVE\": Now step through the unlocked DOOR by moving from (5,3) to (5,4).\n11. \"MOVE\": Continue moving to cell (5,5) in the right room.\n12. \"MOVE\": Move again to (5,6).\n13. \"RIGHT\": Turn right (from facing RIGHT to facing DOWN) to align with the GOAL.\n14. \"MOVE\": Finally, move down into (6,6) where the GOAL is located.\n\nThis sequence of actions allows you to pick up the key, unlock the door, and reach the goal in the correct order."}
