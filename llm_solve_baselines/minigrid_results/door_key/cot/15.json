Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nUP\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nLet's explain the plan step by step:\n\n1. You start at (5,3) facing UP. To head toward the KEY at (1,1) (which must be picked up from an adjacent cell), you first go left.\n   \u2022 \"LEFT\" \u2013 now facing LEFT.\n2. \"MOVE\" \u2013 from (5,3) to (5,2).\n3. \"MOVE\" \u2013 from (5,2) to (5,1).\n4. Now, from (5,1) facing LEFT, you need to go north. Turn upward:\n   \u2022 \"RIGHT\" \u2013 converting LEFT to UP.\n5. \"MOVE\" \u2013 from (5,1) to (4,1).\n6. \"MOVE\" \u2013 from (4,1) to (3,1).\n7. \"MOVE\" \u2013 from (3,1) to (2,1). Now you are adjacent to the key cell (1,1) with the KEY directly in front.\n8. \"PICKUP\" \u2013 picks up the KEY located at (1,1).\n\nNow that you hold the KEY, you must unlock the DOOR at (2,5) to reach the GOAL situated in the other room.\n9. Turn right to face east:\n   \u2022 \"RIGHT\" \u2013 from UP to RIGHT.\n10. \"MOVE\" \u2013 from (2,1) to (2,2).\n11. \"MOVE\" \u2013 from (2,2) to (2,3).\n12. \"MOVE\" \u2013 from (2,3) to (2,4). Now you\u2019re immediately to the left of the door.\n13. \"UNLOCK\" \u2013 since you are facing the door at (2,5) and hold the KEY.\n14. \"MOVE\" \u2013 step into the door\u2019s cell at (2,5).\n15. \"MOVE\" \u2013 from (2,5) to (2,6), entering the room containing the GOAL.\n\nFinally, head from (2,6) to the GOAL at (6,6):\n16. \"RIGHT\" \u2013 from RIGHT to DOWN.\n17. \"MOVE\" \u2013 from (2,6) to (3,6).\n18. \"MOVE\" \u2013 from (3,6) to (4,6).\n19. \"MOVE\" \u2013 from (4,6) to (5,6).\n20. \"MOVE\" \u2013 from (5,6) to (6,6) where the GOAL is located.\n\nThis complete sequence of 20 actions fulfills the objective."}
