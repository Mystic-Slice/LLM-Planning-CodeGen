Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nUP\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n  [\"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Starting at (3,1) facing UP, we first need to head toward the KEY at (6,3) in the left room. Because the KEY is not meant to be stepped into (since the cell holds an object), we position ourselves so that the KEY is directly in front of us.\n   - Actions \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\": Turn from UP to DOWN.\n   - \"MOVE\" three times: (3,1) \u2192 (4,1) \u2192 (5,1) \u2192 (6,1).\n   - \"LEFT\": Turn from DOWN to EAST so that moving forward from (6,1) places us at (6,2).\n   - \"MOVE\": From (6,1) to (6,2).\n   - \"PICKUP\": With the KEY at (6,3) directly in front, pick it up.\n   \n2. With the KEY in hand, we navigate to the door at (3,5) that separates the two rooms. To unlock the door, we must stand at cell (3,4) facing EAST.\n   - From (6,2) facing EAST, \"LEFT\" turns the agent to face NORTH.\n   - \"MOVE\" three times: (6,2) \u2192 (5,2) \u2192 (4,2) \u2192 (3,2).\n   - \"RIGHT\": Turn from NORTH to EAST.\n   - \"MOVE\" twice: (3,2) \u2192 (3,3) \u2192 (3,4).\n   - \"UNLOCK\": With the door at (3,5) directly in front, unlock it.\n   \n3. Finally, we cross through the door and head for the GOAL at (6,6) in the second room.\n   - \"MOVE\": Step into the door cell (3,5).\n   - \"MOVE\": Continue east from (3,5) to (3,6) in the new room.\n   - \"RIGHT\": Turn from EAST to face DOWN.\n   - \"MOVE\" three times: (3,6) \u2192 (4,6) \u2192 (5,6) \u2192 (6,6), reaching the GOAL.\n\nThis sequence satisfies the game\u2019s rules and objectives step by step."}
