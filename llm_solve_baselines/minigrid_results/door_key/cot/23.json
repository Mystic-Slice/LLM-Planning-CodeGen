Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nLEFT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the step\u2010by\u2010step reasoning:\n\n1. You start at [3,1] facing LEFT. To reach the KEY below, you must face DOWN:\n   - Action: \"LEFT\" (turn from LEFT to DOWN).\n\n2. Now, from [3,1] facing DOWN, move forward:\n   - Action: \"MOVE\" to go from [3,1] to [4,1].\n\n3. From [4,1] facing DOWN, the cell immediately in front ([5,1]) contains the KEY:\n   - Action: \"PICKUP\" to acquire the KEY.\n\n4. With the KEY, you need to go to the door at [2,2]. Currently at [4,1] facing DOWN, you must reorient to head upward. From DOWN, two RIGHT turns will have you face UP:\n   - Actions: \"RIGHT\", then \"RIGHT\".\n\n5. Now facing UP at [4,1], move forward twice to reach [2,1]:\n   - Actions: \"MOVE\" (to [3,1]) and then \"MOVE\" (to [2,1]).\n\n6. At [2,1] facing UP, the door is to your right at [2,2]. Turn RIGHT:\n   - Action: \"RIGHT\" (now facing RIGHT).\n\n7. With the door directly ahead and holding the KEY, unlock it:\n   - Action: \"UNLOCK\" (door at [2,2] unlocked).\n\n8. Enter the door by moving forward:\n   - Action: \"MOVE\" (moving from [2,1] into the door cell [2,2]).\n\n9. Now in the second room, take one more MOVE to get past the door:\n   - Action: \"MOVE\" (from [2,2] to [2,3]).\n\n10. To navigate toward the GOAL at [6,6], you need to move down. From [2,3] facing RIGHT, turn RIGHT to face DOWN:\n    - Action: \"RIGHT\".\n\n11. Move downward by four steps:\n    - Actions: \"MOVE\" (to [3,3]), \"MOVE\" (to [4,3]), \"MOVE\" (to [5,3]), and \"MOVE\" (to [6,3]).\n\n12. At [6,3] facing DOWN, the GOAL is to your right. Turn LEFT to face RIGHT:\n    - Action: \"LEFT\".\n\n13. Finally, move three steps to reach the GOAL at [6,6]:\n    - Actions: \"MOVE\" (to [6,4]), \"MOVE\" (to [6,5]), and \"MOVE\" (to [6,6]).\n\nFollowing these 20 actions gets you from the starting position, picking up the KEY, unlocking the DOOR, and finally reaching the GOAL."}
