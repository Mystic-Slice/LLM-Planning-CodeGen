Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"AGENT\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nRIGHT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nLet\u2019s explain the reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The agent starts at cell [3][2] facing RIGHT. The KEY is located at [3][1] \u2013 that is immediately to the WEST of the agent. Since the agent can only pick up an object from the cell directly in front, it needs to reorient to face WEST. Turning 180\u00b0 can be done by issuing two LEFT commands (\u201cLEFT\u201d, \u201cLEFT\u201d).\n\n2. With the agent now facing WEST, the cell in front ([3][1]) holds the KEY. The \u201cPICKUP\u201d command collects the key without moving into that cell.\n\n3. With the key in hand, the agent must now unlock the DOOR. The DOOR is located at [3][3], which is EAST of the starting position. Since the agent is still at [3][2] but now facing WEST, it must reorient to face EAST. A 180\u00b0 turn from WEST is achieved with two RIGHT commands (\u201cRIGHT\u201d, \u201cRIGHT\u201d).\n\n4. Now that the agent is facing EAST, the DOOR is immediately in front. Issuing \u201cUNLOCK\u201d unlocks the door at cell [3][3].\n\n5. To pass through the door and enter the connected room, the agent must \u201cMOVE\u201d from [3][2] to [3][3].\n\n6. Next, from its position at [3][3] and still facing EAST, the agent moves farther into the room where the GOAL is located. Moving EAST:\n   - \u201cMOVE\u201d to [3][4]\n   - \u201cMOVE\u201d to [3][5]\n   - \u201cMOVE\u201d to [3][6]\n   \n   (Note: there is a total of 4 MOVE actions in the EAST direction\u2014one to step through the door and three more to reach column 6.)\n\n7. Once the agent reaches [3][6] (still facing EAST), the GOAL is at cell [6][6]. To approach it, the agent needs to head DOWN. A single \u201cRIGHT\u201d turn from EAST will make the agent face DOWN.\n\n8. Finally, three \u201cMOVE\u201d commands will take the agent from [3][6] to [4][6], then to [5][6], and finally to [6][6] where the GOAL is located.\n\nCombining these steps gives the final sequence of actions as shown above."}
