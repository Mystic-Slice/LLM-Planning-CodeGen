Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"WALL\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nUP\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions> \n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n1. Starting at (6,4) facing UP, we turn LEFT so that we face WEST. Then, we MOVE three times to go from (6,4) to (6,3), then to (6,2) and to (6,1).\n2. At (6,1) facing LEFT, we turn RIGHT to face UP. We then MOVE four times from (6,1) to (5,1), then to (4,1), (3,1) and finally to (2,1). Now, the KEY at (1,1) is directly in front of us.\n3. We PICKUP the KEY from (1,1) while standing at (2,1) facing UP.\n4. With the KEY in hand, we now navigate to the door. From (2,1) facing UP, we turn RIGHT (facing EAST) and MOVE three times to go from (2,1) to (2,2), (2,3), and (2,4). Then, we turn LEFT to face UP and MOVE once to reach (1,4) \u2013 the cell adjacent to the DOOR located at (1,5).\n5. At (1,4) facing UP, we turn RIGHT (to face EAST) so that the DOOR is directly ahead, and then UNLOCK it.\n6. After unlocking the door at (1,5), we MOVE forward; the first MOVE takes us into the door cell (1,5) and the next MOVE brings us into the right room at (1,6).\n7. In the right room at (1,6) facing EAST, we now need to reach the GOAL at (6,6). We turn RIGHT to face DOWN and MOVE five times, progressing through rows (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6) and finally arriving at (6,6), where the GOAL is located.\n\nThis sequence of 26 actions achieves the objective."}
