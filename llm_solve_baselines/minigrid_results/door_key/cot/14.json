Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nDOWN\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "We first analyze the grid:\n\n\u2022 Rows are numbered 0\u20137 and columns 0\u20137. The outer boundary is all WALLs.\n\u2022 In rows 1\u20136, look at the following key cells:\n\u2003\u2013 The left \u201croom\u201d (accessible area) is essentially column 1. Notice row2 col1 holds the KEY and row5 col1 holds AGENT.\n\u2003\u2013 The wall separating rooms is in column 2 except at row1 where there is a DOOR. (So the door at row1 col2 is the only opening to the other room.)\n\u2003\u2013 The \u201cright\u201d room (the destination area) comprises columns 3\u20136. The GOAL is at row6 col6.\n\nStarting conditions:\n\u2003\u2022 The AGENT is at row5 col1 facing DOWN.\n\u2003\u2022 To open the door (located in row1 col2) the agent must first pick up the KEY (at row2 col1). \n\u2003\u2022 To pick up an object, the agent must be directly adjacent to it and facing it.\n\nOur step\u2010by-step plan is as follows:\n\n1. Since the AGENT faces DOWN but needs to pick up the KEY (which lies upward from row5 col1), we reorient the agent to face UP. (From DOWN, two RIGHT turns will face UP.)\n2. Then, the agent will move \u201cup\u201d but stop one cell before the key. In detail, the AGENT goes:\n\u2003\u2003a. From (5,1) \u2192 (4,1)\n\u2003\u2003b. Then to (3,1) so that the cell in front (i.e. (2,1)) has the KEY.\n3. With the agent at (3,1) and facing UP, performing a PICKUP will grab the KEY from the cell (2,1). (Note: This ensures that the AGENT does not \u201center\u201d the KEY cell, which is required by the rules.)\n4. Next, we head toward the DOOR. A good adjacent cell to approach from is (1,1) because then the door at (1,2) will be directly in front when facing RIGHT.\n\u2003\u2003a. From (3,1) (still facing UP) move to (2,1) (now empty) and then to (1,1).\n5. At (1,1), turning RIGHT (from UP) will let the AGENT face RIGHT so that the DOOR (at (1,2)) is in front.\n6. Now, since the agent is holding the KEY and the door is directly ahead, the UNLOCK action will open the door.\n7. After unlocking, the agent \u201cmoves\u201d into the door cell at (1,2) and then takes another MOVE to step fully into the right room (cell (1,3)).\n8. In the right room the path to the GOAL (at (6,6)) is clear. From (1,3) facing RIGHT, the plan is to:\n\u2003\u2003a. MOVE east until reaching (1,6)\n\u2003\u2003b. Then turn RIGHT (which from east makes the agent face SOUTH).\n\u2003\u2003c. MOVE down from row 1 to row 6 in column 6.\n\nThus, putting all these actions into a list we get:\n\nStep-by-step actions:\n1.
