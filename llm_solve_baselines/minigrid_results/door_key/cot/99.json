Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nLEFT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n    [\"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Starting at (6,2) facing LEFT. First, we want to go upward toward the key at (2,3). Since the agent is facing LEFT, a \"RIGHT\" turn makes it face UP.\n2. Then, perform \"MOVE\" four times to go from (6,2) \u2192 (5,2) \u2192 (4,2) \u2192 (3,2) \u2192 (2,2).\n3. At (2,2) and still facing UP, the key is located at (2,3), which is to the agent\u2019s right (east). Turning \"RIGHT\" changes the facing direction from UP to EAST.\n4. Now, with the cell (2,3) in front, executing \"PICKUP\" collects the KEY.\n5. With the key in hand, the agent now needs to go to the DOOR at (1,5). A good approach is to position the agent at (1,4) and face EAST. To start heading north from (2,2) (currently facing EAST), a \"LEFT\" turn orients the agent north.\n6. A \"MOVE\" brings the agent from (2,2) to (1,2).\n7. From (1,2) facing NORTH, a \"RIGHT\" turn sets the direction to EAST.\n8. Two \"MOVE\" actions from (1,2) lead the agent first to (1,3) then to (1,4).\n9. At (1,4) facing EAST, the door (at (1,5)) is directly in front. The \"UNLOCK\" command uses the key to unlock the door.\n10. After unlocking, a \"MOVE\" steps into the door cell (1,5).\n11. Next, another \"MOVE\" (still facing EAST) carries the agent to (1,6) in the adjacent (right) room.\n12. To head toward the GOAL at (6,6), which lies south, the agent turns \"RIGHT\" (from EAST to SOUTH).\n13. Finally, five consecutive \"MOVE\" actions take the agent from (1,6) down through (2,6), (3,6), (4,6), (5,6) and finally to (6,6) where the GOAL is located.\n\nThis is the complete action sequence."}
