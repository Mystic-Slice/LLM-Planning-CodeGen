Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nDOWN\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Starting at (2,1) facing DOWN, we need to pick up the KEY at (1,2). To do so, first we must reorient so that we can stand adjacent to the KEY.\n   - \"LEFT\" turns us from DOWN to RIGHT.\n   - \"LEFT\" again turns us from RIGHT to UP.\n2. With the agent now facing UP, \"MOVE\" takes us from (2,1) to (1,1). From here the KEY is one cell to the right.\n   - \"RIGHT\" turns our facing from UP to RIGHT.\n   - \"PICKUP\" picks the KEY from (1,2) (directly in front).\n3. Now holding the key, we must head to the door. The door is located at (5,5) in the other room but can only be unlocked if approached from room1. The accessible adjacent cell in room1 is (5,4). We plan our path from (1,1) to (5,4):\n   - \"MOVE\" (facing RIGHT) moves us from (1,1) to (1,2).\n   - \"MOVE\" takes us to (1,3).\n   - \"MOVE\" takes us to (1,4).\n   - \"RIGHT\" (from facing RIGHT) rotates us to face DOWN.\n   - Then \"MOVE\" successively brings us: \n       \u2022 from (1,4) to (2,4),\n       \u2022 then to (3,4),\n       \u2022 then to (4,4),\n       \u2022 and finally to (5,4).\n4. At (5,4) facing DOWN, we need to approach the door at (5,5) from the left. Turning \"LEFT\" from DOWN makes us face RIGHT.\n5. With the door now directly in front, \"UNLOCK\" opens it.\n6. Next, cross the doorway:\n   - \"MOVE\" steps into the door cell (5,5).\n   - \"MOVE\" then takes us to (5,6).\n7. To reach the GOAL at (6,6), from (5,6) (facing RIGHT), a \"RIGHT\" turn sets our facing to DOWN.\n8. Finally, \"MOVE\" brings us from (5,6) to the GOAL at (6,6).\n\nThis complete sequence of actions achieves the objective of picking up the key, unlocking the door, and reaching the goal."}
