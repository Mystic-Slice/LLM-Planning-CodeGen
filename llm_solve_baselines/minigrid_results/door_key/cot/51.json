Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nLEFT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions> \n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. From the starting position [3,2] facing LEFT, the agent first moves left into [3,1].\n2. The agent then turns RIGHT (from LEFT to UP) so that moving forward will head upward.\n3. A MOVE takes the agent from [3,1] to [2,1]. From here the KEY at [1,1] lies directly ahead.\n4. A PICKUP collects the KEY from the cell above ([1,1]).\n5. To approach the DOOR at [1,3], the agent turns RIGHT (facing UP to face RIGHT).\n6. A MOVE brings the agent from [2,1] to [2,2].\n7. A LEFT turn from RIGHT changes the facing direction to UP.\n8. A MOVE takes the agent from [2,2] to [1,2] where the DOOR is located to the right.\n9. The agent turns RIGHT (UP to RIGHT) so that the cell in front ([1,3]) is the DOOR.\n10. With the KEY in hand, the agent executes UNLOCK to unlock the DOOR.\n11. A MOVE steps into the unlocked DOOR cell ([1,3]).\n12. Another MOVE carries the agent further into the next room at [1,4].\n13. To head toward the GOAL at [6,6], the agent turns RIGHT: now facing down.\n14-18. Five consecutive MOVEs bring the agent downward from [1,4] to [6,4].\n19. At [6,4] facing down, a LEFT turn rotates the agent to face RIGHT.\n20-21. Two MOVEs finally carry the agent from [6,4] to [6,5] and then to [6,6], where the GOAL is located.\n\nThis sequence satisfies the requirement: obtaining the KEY, unlocking the DOOR, and navigating to the GOAL."}
