Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nLEFT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n    [\"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the reasoning step by step:\n\n1. Starting at (5,4) facing LEFT, the first task is to get the key at (2,2) without stepping into its cell. Since the key must be picked up from an adjacent cell, we first need to reorient. Turning RIGHT from LEFT makes you face UP.\n2. From (5,4) facing UP the three MOVE actions take you from row 5 \u2192 4 \u2192 3 \u2192 2, arriving at (2,4).\n3. Next, you need to approach the key (located at (2,2)) from the east. Turning LEFT from UP makes you face LEFT and then a MOVE brings you to (2,3). Now (2,2) is directly in front of you, so executing PICKUP collects the KEY.\n4. With the KEY in hand, you must unlock the door at (2,5). Since you\u2019re currently at (2,3) facing LEFT, you first turn around to face RIGHT by performing two turns (RIGHT, RIGHT). A MOVE then brings you back to (2,4) from where the door at (2,5) is directly in front.\n5. The UNLOCK action is executed to unlock the door at (2,5). After unlocking, you use a MOVE to step into the door cell and another MOVE to enter the adjacent room (arriving at (2,6)).\n6. Now that you are in the room that contains the GOAL (at (6,6)), you need to head there. Facing RIGHT, a single RIGHT turn orients you DOWN.\n7. Finally, four consecutive MOVE commands take you down from row 2 to row 6, arriving at (6,6) where the GOAL is located.\n\nThis sequence of actions satisfies the game\u2019s requirements."}
