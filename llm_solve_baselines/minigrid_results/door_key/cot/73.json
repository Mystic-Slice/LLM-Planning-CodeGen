Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nDOWN\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Starting at (6,2) facing DOWN, the first \"LEFT\" turns you to face RIGHT.\n2. Two \"MOVE\" actions take you from (6,2) \u2192 (6,3) then (6,3) \u2192 (6,4).\n3. With the key at (5,4) directly above, the next \"LEFT\" (from RIGHT) sets your direction to UP.\n4. Now \"PICKUP\" grabs the KEY from the cell in front (i.e. (5,4)). (You remain at (6,4) after PICKUP.)\n5. From (6,4) facing UP, five \"MOVE\" actions (steps 6\u201310) take you straight upward:\n   - (6,4) \u2192 (5,4) [cell now empty since key was picked],\n   - (5,4) \u2192 (4,4),\n   - (4,4) \u2192 (3,4),\n   - (3,4) \u2192 (2,4),\n   - (2,4) \u2192 (1,4).\n6. At (1,4) you need the DOOR at (1,5) to be directly in front, so you \"RIGHT\" turn (from UP to RIGHT).\n7. Now \"UNLOCK\" unlocks the door at (1,5) since you\u2019re holding the KEY.\n8. Next two \"MOVE\" actions (steps 13\u201314) take you:\n   - (1,4) \u2192 (1,5) (through the now-unlocked door),\n   - (1,5) \u2192 (1,6) to enter the room with the GOAL.\n9. To head towards the GOAL located at (6,6), a \"RIGHT\" turn faces you DOWN (from RIGHT).\n10. Finally, five \"MOVE\" actions bring you down the corridor from (1,6) to:\n    - (2,6),\n    - (3,6),\n    - (4,6),\n    - (5,6),\n    - and finally (6,6), reaching the GOAL.\n\nThis sequence of actions lets you pick up the key, unlock the door, and then navigate to the goal as required."}
