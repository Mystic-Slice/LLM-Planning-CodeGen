Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nDOWN\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nLet's explain the plan step by step:\n\n1. Starting at (5,1) facing DOWN, we need to get to the KEY at (1,1) which is located in the cell directly above (when reached from (2,1)). Since we\u2019re facing DOWN, we turn around by doing \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\" (which makes us face UP).\n\n2. We then move forward:\n   - \"MOVE\": from (5,1) to (4,1)\n   - \"MOVE\": from (4,1) to (3,1)\n   - \"MOVE\": from (3,1) to (2,1)\n   \n3. With the KEY at (1,1) now directly in front of us (from (2,1) facing UP), we \"PICKUP\" the KEY.\n\n4. Next, we need to reach the door located at (3,2) from the left side (adjacent cell (3,1)). Our agent is at (2,1) still facing UP, but we must move downward. To do this, we reorient by executing \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\" to face DOWN, then \"MOVE\" to go from (2,1) to (3,1).\n\n5. At (3,1) facing DOWN, we want to approach the door which is east so we \"LEFT\" turn (from DOWN to EAST).\n\n6. Now, the door at (3,2) is directly in front. We \"UNLOCK\" it (since we\u2019re holding the KEY).\n\n7. We then move into the newly unlocked door cell by \"MOVE\" (from (3,1) to (3,2)).\n\n8. Once through the door, our goal (GOAL) is at (6,6). A clear path in the second room is to move east first along row 3:\n   - \"MOVE\": (3,2) to (3,3)\n   - \"MOVE\": (3,3) to (3,4)\n   - \"MOVE\": (3,4) to (3,5)\n   - \"MOVE\": (3,5) to (3,6)\n   \n9. At (3,6) and facing EAST, we then turn \"RIGHT\" to face SOUTH.\n\n10. Finally, we move south down the column:\n    - \"MOVE\": from (3,6) to (4,6)\n    - \"MOVE\": from (4,6) to (5,6)\n    - \"MOVE\": from (5,6) to (6,6) which is the GOAL.\n    \nThis sequence gets the agent from its starting position, collects the KEY, unlocks the DOOR, and navigates to the GOAL."}
