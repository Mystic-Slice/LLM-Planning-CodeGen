Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nLEFT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\",\n     \"MOVE\",\n     \"MOVE\",\n     \"MOVE\",\n     \"MOVE\",\n     \"MOVE\",\n     \"LEFT\",\n     \"PICKUP\",\n     \"LEFT\",\n     \"MOVE\",\n     \"MOVE\",\n     \"MOVE\",\n     \"MOVE\",\n     \"RIGHT\",\n     \"MOVE\",\n     \"MOVE\",\n     \"UNLOCK\",\n     \"MOVE\",\n     \"MOVE\",\n     \"RIGHT\",\n     \"MOVE\",\n     \"MOVE\",\n     \"MOVE\",\n     \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the step\u2010by\u2010step reasoning:\n\n1. Starting at (1,2) facing LEFT, the agent first needs to get to the KEY located at (6,3) without entering the cell that contains it. Thus, the agent positions itself at (6,2), facing east:\n   - \"LEFT\": Turn from LEFT to face DOWN.\n   - \"MOVE\" x5: Move down from (1,2) \u2192 (2,2) \u2192 (3,2) \u2192 (4,2) \u2192 (5,2) \u2192 (6,2).\n   - \"LEFT\": Turn from DOWN to face EAST.\n   - \"PICKUP\": Pick up the key from the adjacent cell (6,3).\n\n2. With the KEY in hand, the agent now needs to reach the door at (2,5) from the left side (the door is at the boundary between rooms). The agent must approach so that the door is directly in front:\n   - \"LEFT\": Turn from EAST to face NORTH.\n   - \"MOVE\" x4: Move north from (6,2) \u2192 (5,2) \u2192 (4,2) \u2192 (3,2) \u2192 (2,2).\n   - \"RIGHT\": Turn from NORTH to face EAST.\n   - \"MOVE\" x2: Move east from (2,2) \u2192 (2,3) \u2192 (2,4).\n\n3. Now the door (at (2,5)) is directly in front:\n   - \"UNLOCK\": Unlock the door while holding the KEY.\n   - \"MOVE\": Step into the door cell at (2,5).\n\n4. After entering the door, the agent enters the right room. The GOAL is at (6,6). The agent then:\n   - \"MOVE\": Move east from (2,5) to (2,6).\n   - \"RIGHT\": Turn from EAST to face SOUTH.\n   - \"MOVE\" x4: Move south from (2,6) \u2192 (3,6) \u2192 (4,6) \u2192 (5,6) \u2192 (6,6), reaching the GOAL.\n\nThis sequence of actions successfully navigates the agent from the starting location, retrieves the key, unlocks the door between rooms, and reaches the GOAL cell."}
