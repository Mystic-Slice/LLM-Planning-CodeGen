Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nRIGHT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nLet's explain the plan step by step:\n\n1. The agent starts at [1][3] facing RIGHT. To head toward the key at [4][1] in the left room, the agent first turns left twice to face WEST.\n2. Two MOVEs take the agent from [1][3] to [1][2] and then to [1][1].\n3. Then, a LEFT turn from facing WEST rotates the agent to face SOUTH.\n4. Two MOVEs then bring the agent down from [1][1] to [2][1] and then to [3][1]. At this point, the key is directly in front (at [4][1]), so the agent executes PICKUP.\n5. Now holding the key, the agent must head to the door at [1][5]. From [3][1] facing SOUTH, two LEFT turns (SOUTH\u2192EAST\u2192NORTH) reorient it to face NORTH.\n6. Two MOVEs bring the agent back upward from [3][1] to [2][1] and then to [1][1].\n7. A RIGHT turn now changes the agent\u2019s direction from NORTH to EAST.\n8. Three MOVEs then carry the agent from [1][1] to [1][2], then to [1][3], and finally to [1][4]. Now the DOOR at [1][5] is directly ahead.\n9. With the key in hand, the agent uses UNLOCK to open the door.\n10. One MOVE enters the door cell at [1][5], and a second MOVE takes the agent into the adjacent right room cell at [1][6].\n11. A RIGHT turn changes the agent\u2019s facing from EAST to SOUTH.\n12. Finally, five MOVEs guide the agent downward through cells [2][6], [3][6], [4][6], [5][6] and finally to [6][6], where the GOAL is located.\n\nThis sequence meets the challenge requirements of retrieving the KEY, unlocking the DOOR and proceeding to the GOAL in the right room."}
