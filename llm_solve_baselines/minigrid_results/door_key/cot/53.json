Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nDOWN\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nLet's explain the reasoning step\u2010by\u2010step:\n\n1. Starting at (6,3) facing DOWN in the left room (the same room as the key), we want to get the key at (2,4) without stepping into its cell (since you can\u2019t walk into a cell containing an object). We instead need to stand in an adjacent cell and pick the key up.\n2. First, we turn LEFT (while facing DOWN) which makes us face RIGHT. Then we MOVE to (6,4).\n3. Next, we turn LEFT to go from facing RIGHT to facing UP. Now, we make three MOVE actions: moving from (6,4) to (5,4), then to (4,4), and finally to (3,4). Now we are directly beneath the key: the key is in the cell (2,4) (one cell up).\n4. With our agent facing UP, we use PICKUP to grab the key from (2,4).\n5. Now that we have the key, we must unlock the door at (3,5). The door lies immediately to our right of (3,4), so we turn RIGHT (from UP to RIGHT) and then use UNLOCK while facing the door.\n6. After unlocking, we MOVE into the door\u2019s cell at (3,5).\n7. Once inside the right room, to reach the GOAL at (6,6), we take another MOVE from (3,5) to (3,6). Now, to head downward towards the goal, we turn RIGHT (from facing RIGHT to facing DOWN).\n8. Finally, we execute three MOVE actions: from (3,6) to (4,6), then to (5,6), and lastly to (6,6) where the GOAL is located.\n\nThis complete sequence of 15 actions satisfies the objective."}
