Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nUP\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n    [\"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nLet's explain the reasoning step by step:\n\n1. Starting at row4, col1 and facing UP, the agent \"MOVE\"s into row3, col1. Now the KEY is directly in front, at row2, col1.\n2. The \"PICKUP\" action retrieves the KEY from row2, col1.\n3. With the KEY in hand and still at row3, col1 facing UP, the agent turns \"RIGHT\" to face east so that the DOOR (located at row3, col2) is directly ahead.\n4. The \"UNLOCK\" action unlocks the DOOR.\n5. The agent then \"MOVE\"s into the door cell at row3, col2.\n6. From there, continuing \"MOVE\" while facing RIGHT brings the agent to row3, col3.\n7. To enter the next room, the agent turns \"RIGHT\" (from RIGHT, turning right yields DOWN).\n8. A \"MOVE\" takes the agent to row4, col3.\n9. Another \"MOVE\" puts the agent in row5, col3.\n10. A subsequent \"MOVE\" takes the agent into row6, col3.\n11. Now at row6, col3 facing DOWN, the agent turns \"LEFT\" (which orients the agent to face RIGHT).\n12. Finally, three consecutive \"MOVE\"s take the agent from row6, col3 to row6, col4, then row6, col5, and finally into row6, col6 where the GOAL is located.\n\nBy following this sequence, the agent successfully picks up the KEY, unlocks the DOOR between rooms, and reaches the GOAL."}
