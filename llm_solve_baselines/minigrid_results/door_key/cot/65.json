Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nDOWN\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. Starting from row2, col1 facing DOWN, the cell directly ahead (row3, col1) has the KEY. So we execute \"PICKUP\" to grab it.\n2. We then need to bring the key to the door. From row2, col1 (still facing DOWN after the pickup), we move down:\n   - \"MOVE\": from row2, col1 to row3, col1.\n   - \"MOVE\": from row3, col1 to row4, col1.\n   - \"MOVE\": from row4, col1 to row5, col1.\n3. At row5, col1, the DOOR is to our right (east). With our current facing (DOWN), we turn to face east by executing \"LEFT\" (since turning left from DOWN yields EAST).\n4. Now, standing at row5, col1 facing east, the cell directly ahead (row5, col2) holds the DOOR. Since we hold the key, we \"UNLOCK\" the door.\n5. With the door unlocked, we move into and through it:\n   - \"MOVE\": from row5, col1 into the door cell at row5, col2.\n   - \"MOVE\": from row5, col2 to row5, col3.\n   - \"MOVE\": from row5, col3 to row5, col4.\n   - \"MOVE\": from row5, col4 to row5, col5.\n   - \"MOVE\": from row5, col5 to row5, col6.\n6. Now at row5, col6 facing east, the GOAL lies one cell down (row6, col6). We turn to face down with \"RIGHT\" (east \u2192 down) and then \"MOVE\" into the GOAL cell.\n\nThus, the full action sequence is as listed above."}
