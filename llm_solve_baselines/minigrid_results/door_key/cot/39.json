Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nLEFT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the step\u2010by\u2010step reasoning:\n\n1. Starting at (1,2) facing LEFT. Since the KEY is at (6,1) and must be picked up from an adjacent cell, we choose to position ourselves at (5,1) facing down so that the cell in front (6,1) holds the KEY.\n   - \"MOVE\": move from (1,2) to (1,1) (facing LEFT).\n   - \"LEFT\": from LEFT, turning LEFT faces DOWN.\n   - \"MOVE\": from (1,1) to (2,1).\n   - \"MOVE\": from (2,1) to (3,1).\n   - \"MOVE\": from (3,1) to (4,1).\n   - \"MOVE\": from (4,1) to (5,1).\n   - \"PICKUP\": with the agent at (5,1) facing DOWN, the cell (6,1) contains the KEY, so pick it up.\n\n2. Next, we must unlock the DOOR at (4,5), but to do that we must stand in the cell adjacent to it. The accessible adjacent cell in the left room is (4,4); from (4,4) if we face RIGHT, the door at (4,5) will be directly in front.\n   - From (5,1) facing DOWN, we need to move to (4,1). To do that we must reverse direction:\n     - \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\": a 180\u00b0 turn (facing DOWN to UP).\n     - \"MOVE\": move from (5,1) to (4,1) (now facing UP).\n   - Now at (4,1) facing UP, turn to face RIGHT:\n     - \"RIGHT\": now facing RIGHT.\n   - Move right in row 4:\n     - \"MOVE\": from (4,1) to (4,2).\n     - \"MOVE\": from (4,2) to (4,3).\n     - \"MOVE\": from (4,3) to (4,4).\n   - From (4,4) facing RIGHT, the door at (4,5) is directly ahead:\n     - \"UNLOCK\": unlock the door (provided you are holding the KEY).\n     - \"MOVE\": step into the door cell at (4,5).\n\n3. Now in the right room (having passed through the unlocked door), the GOAL is at (6,6). From (4,5) facing RIGHT, plan a path:\n   - \"MOVE\": from (4,5) to (4,6) (still facing RIGHT).\n   - The next desired cell is (5,6) which is downward from (4,6), so adjust orientation:\n     - \"RIGHT\": turn from RIGHT to face DOWN.\n   - \"MOVE\": from (4,6) to (5,6) (facing DOWN).\n   - \"MOVE\": from (5,6) to (6,6) (facing DOWN), landing on the GOAL.\n\nThese steps yield the complete action list above."}
