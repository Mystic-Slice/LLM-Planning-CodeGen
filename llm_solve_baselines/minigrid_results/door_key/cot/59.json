Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nUP\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n    [\"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n1. Starting at (5,2) facing UP, the agent moves upward three times to reach (2,2):\n   - MOVE: from (5,2) to (4,2)\n   - MOVE: from (4,2) to (3,2)\n   - MOVE: from (3,2) to (2,2)\n2. At (2,2) and facing UP, the agent turns LEFT to face LEFT. The key is at (2,1) (directly to the left), so:\n   - LEFT\n   - PICKUP (picks up the key)\n3. Now at (2,2) facing LEFT but needing to head toward the door, the agent must face RIGHT. Two LEFT turns will change LEFT to RIGHT:\n   - LEFT\n   - LEFT\n4. With the agent now facing RIGHT, he moves east to approach the door. The chosen path is:\n   - MOVE: from (2,2) to (2,3)\n   - MOVE: from (2,3) to (2,4)\n5. To start heading downward toward the door\u2019s row (door is at (4,5)), the agent turns RIGHT (from facing RIGHT to facing DOWN) and moves:\n   - RIGHT\n   - MOVE: from (2,4) to (3,4)\n   - MOVE: from (3,4) to (4,4)\n6. At (4,4) facing DOWN, the door at (4,5) is to the EAST. A LEFT turn from DOWN points EAST:\n   - LEFT\n7. The agent now uses the key to unlock the door directly in front:\n   - UNLOCK\n8. With the door unlocked, the agent moves into the door cell and then further into the next room toward the GOAL:\n   - MOVE: from (4,4) to (4,5) (through the unlocked door)\n   - MOVE: from (4,5) to (4,6)\n9. Facing EAST at (4,6), the agent turns RIGHT to face DOWN, then proceeds to move down to the GOAL (located at (6,6)):\n   - RIGHT\n   - MOVE: from (4,6) to (5,6)\n   - MOVE: from (5,6) to (6,6)\n\nThis sequence of actions satisfies the game\u2019s objectives: pick up the KEY, unlock the DOOR, and move into the room containing the GOAL."}
