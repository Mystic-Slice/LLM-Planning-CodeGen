Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nUP\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n1. Starting at (1,1) facing UP. We first need to face downward to pick up the KEY that is located in the cell at (4,1). From UP, two LEFT turns will make you face DOWN.\n2. With the agent now facing DOWN, the first MOVE takes you from (1,1) to (2,1) and the next MOVE takes you to (3,1).\n3. Now while at (3,1) facing DOWN, the cell directly ahead (4,1) contains the KEY. The PICKUP action collects it.\n4. With the key in hand and still at (3,1) facing down, two consecutive MOVEs (first to (4,1) then to (5,1)) get you closer to the DOOR.\n5. At (5,1) facing DOWN, the DOOR is to your right at (5,2). A single LEFT turn (turning from DOWN to RIGHT) aligns you so the DOOR is in the cell directly in front.\n6. Now facing the DOOR, the UNLOCK action uses the held KEY to unlock the DOOR.\n7. The next MOVE enters the door cell at (5,2). Then a series of four MOVEs takes you along the room from (5,2) to (5,3), (5,3) to (5,4), (5,4) to (5,5), and (5,5) to (5,6).\n8. At (5,6) still facing RIGHT, the GOAL at (6,6) lies directly below. A RIGHT turn from facing RIGHT changes your orientation to DOWN, and the final MOVE takes you to (6,6) where the GOAL is located.\n\nThus, the above list of 16 actions will successfully navigate from the starting point, collect the KEY, unlock the DOOR, and finally reach the GOAL."}
