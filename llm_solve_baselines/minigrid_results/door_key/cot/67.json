Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nRIGHT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nLet's explain the reasoning step by step:\n\n1. The agent starts at [4][2] facing RIGHT. To reach the KEY at [5][1] without stepping on it (since PICKUP only works on the adjacent cell in front), the agent first turns RIGHT to face DOWN.\n2. The agent then moves from [4][2] to [5][2]. Now, standing at [5][2] and facing DOWN, a further RIGHT turn makes the agent face WEST. With this orientation, the cell directly ahead ([5][1]) contains the KEY.\n3. The agent executes PICKUP to retrieve the KEY.\n4. Now holding the KEY and positioned at [5][2] (facing WEST), the agent plans the return journey through the first room toward the door at [3][5]. The door must be unlocked from the cell immediately to its left (i.e. from [3][4] while facing EAST).\n5. From [5][2] facing WEST, a RIGHT turn makes the agent face NORTH. Two successive MOVE actions bring the agent from [5][2] to [4][2] and then [3][2].\n6. At [3][2] facing NORTH, a RIGHT turn directs the agent to face EAST. Two MOVE actions then bring the agent from [3][2] to [3][3] and then to [3][4].\n7. At [3][4] facing EAST, the door at [3][5] is directly ahead. The agent executes the UNLOCK action (using the KEY) to open the door.\n8. A MOVE takes the agent into the now-unlocked door cell [3][5] (now in the second room). Another MOVE moves the agent further east into [3][6].\n9. At [3][6] and still facing EAST, a RIGHT turn makes the agent face SOUTH. Then three successive MOVE actions take the agent from [3][6] to [4][6], then to [5][6], and finally to [6][6] where the GOAL is located.\n10. Once the agent stands on the GOAL cell, the game is complete.\n\nThe final sequence of actions is as provided above."}
