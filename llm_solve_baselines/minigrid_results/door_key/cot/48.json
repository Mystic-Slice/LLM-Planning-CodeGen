Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nLEFT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the step\u2010by\u2010step reasoning:\n\n1. The agent starts at [5,1] facing LEFT. The KEY is at [6,1] (directly \u201csouth\u201d of the agent).  \n   \u2022 First, turn LEFT so that from facing LEFT the agent now faces DOWN.  \n   \u2022 Then, use PICKUP to grab the KEY from the cell in front (i.e. [6,1]).\n\n2. Now holding the KEY, the agent needs to go to the DOOR at [1,2] (the only passage between two rooms). The best approach is to reach a cell adjacent to the door.  \n   \u2022 The door\u2019s accessible adjacent cell is [1,1] (to its left).  \n   \u2022 To get there, the agent must face UP. Currently facing DOWN, the agent makes two LEFT turns (DOWN \u2192 RIGHT \u2192 UP).  \n   \u2022 Then, MOVE four times to go from [5,1] up to [1,1].\n\n3. At [1,1] facing UP, the door ([1,2]) lies to the agent\u2019s right.  \n   \u2022 Turn RIGHT so the agent now faces EAST (toward the door).  \n   \u2022 Execute UNLOCK to unlock the door in the cell immediately ahead ([1,2]).  \n   \u2022 MOVE forward to step into the door cell.\n\n4. Now that the door is unlocked, the agent is in the passage to the right room. The GOAL is at [6,6]. From the door cell ([1,2]), the agent must move right and then down.  \n   \u2022 With the agent still facing EAST, MOVE four times: from [1,2] to [1,3], then to [1,4], [1,5], and finally [1,6].  \n   \u2022 Then, turn RIGHT to face DOWN.  \n   \u2022 Finally, MOVE five times to descend from row 1 to row 6, arriving at [6,6] where the GOAL is located.\n\nThis planned sequence of actions ensures that the agent picks up the key, unlocks the door, navigates into the right room, and finally reaches the goal."}
