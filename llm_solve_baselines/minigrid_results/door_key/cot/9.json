Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"KEY\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nUP\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n    [\"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Initially, you are at (5,1) facing UP. The KEY is at (5,2)\u2014to your right. So, you turn RIGHT to face EAST.\n2. While facing EAST, the cell in front (5,2) contains the KEY. You use PICKUP to collect it.\n3. Now, with the KEY in hand, you MOVE forward from (5,1) to (5,2).\n4. To approach the DOOR located at (4,3), you need to position yourself to the left of it. From (5,2), turn LEFT (facing NORTH).\n5. MOVE NORTH from (5,2) to (4,2). Now you\u2019re immediately to the left of the DOOR.\n6. Turning RIGHT from NORTH makes you face EAST toward the DOOR.\n7. With the door directly in front of you at (4,3) and holding the KEY, execute UNLOCK.\n8. MOVE forward into the now-unlocked door cell (4,3). This transitions you into the room that leads to the GOAL.\n9. From (4,3) (facing EAST), MOVE to (4,4).\n10. MOVE to (4,5).\n11. MOVE to (4,6).\n12. The GOAL is at (6,6), which is two rows down. While facing EAST, turn RIGHT to face SOUTH.\n13. MOVE SOUTH from (4,6) to (5,6).\n14. Finally, MOVE from (5,6) to (6,6) to stand on the GOAL and complete the game.\n"}
