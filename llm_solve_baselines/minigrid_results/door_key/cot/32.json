Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nDOWN\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. You start at [3,2] facing DOWN. From here, the key is located at [5,1] (in your room).  \n   \u2022 First, move forward twice:\n\u2003\u2003- \"MOVE\": from [3,2] to [4,2].\n\u2003\u2003- \"MOVE\": from [4,2] to [5,2].\n\n2. The key sits at [5,1], which is directly to your WEST when at [5,2]. Since you\u2019re currently facing DOWN, you need to turn RIGHT (facing west when starting from DOWN, because when facing south, a right turn points west).  \n   \u2022 \"RIGHT\": now facing WEST.\n   \u2022 \"PICKUP\": picks up the key from the cell directly in front ([5,1]).\n\n3. With the key in hand, your next objective is the DOOR at [2,5]. To unlock it you must be adjacent and facing it. The ideal approach is to go to cell [2,4] and face EAST so that the door at [2,5] is directly ahead.  \n   \u2022 From [5,2] (still holding the key and currently facing WEST), turn to face NORTH. When facing WEST, a \"RIGHT\" turn yields NORTH.\n\u2003\u2003- \"RIGHT\": now facing NORTH.\n\u2003\u2003- \"MOVE\": from [5,2] to [4,2].\n\u2003\u2003- \"MOVE\": from [4,2] to [3,2].\n\u2003\u2003- \"MOVE\": from [3,2] to [2,2].\n\n4. Now at [2,2] and facing NORTH, you must head east. Turning right from NORTH gives you EAST.\n\u2003\u2003- \"RIGHT\": now facing EAST.\n\u2003\u2003- \"MOVE\": from [2,2] to [2,3].\n\u2003\u2003- \"MOVE\": from [2,3] to [2,4].\n\n5. You are now positioned at [2,4] facing EAST, with the DOOR ([2,5]) directly in front. Use the key to unlock the door.\n\u2003\u2003- \"UNLOCK\": unlocks the door at [2,5].\n\n6. Proceed through the door.  \n\u2003\u2003- \"MOVE\": steps into the door cell at [2,5].  \n\u2003\u2003- \"MOVE\": from [2,5] to [2,6] (entering the adjacent room where the goal is located).\n\n7. In the new room, the GOAL is at [6,6]. From your current position [2,6], face SOUTH. From EAST, a \"RIGHT\" turn makes you face SOUTH.\n\u2003\u2003- \"RIGHT\": now facing SOUTH.\n\u2003\u2003Then move downward:\n\u2003\u2003- \"MOVE\": from [2,6] to [3,6].\n\u2003\u2003- \"MOVE\": from [3,6] to [4,6].\n\u2003\u2003- \"MOVE\": from [4,6] to [5,6].\n\u2003\u2003- \"MOVE\": from [5,6] to [6,6] (goal reached).\n\nThis sequence completes the objective."}
