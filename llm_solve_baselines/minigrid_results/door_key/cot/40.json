Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nUP\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n    [\"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nLet's explain step by step:\n\n1. Starting at (3,2) facing UP, we want to pick up the KEY at (5,3) without moving into its cell. So we first turn right twice to face DOWN, then move two steps to get to (5,2).  \n   - Actions: \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\".\n\n2. At (5,2) facing DOWN, we turn LEFT so that we face RIGHT. Now the KEY is directly in front (at (5,3)), so we use \"PICKUP\" to collect it.  \n   - Actions: \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\".\n\n3. With the key in hand, we now need to get in position to unlock the DOOR at (1,4). To interact with the door, we plan to stand at (1,3) (which is immediately to the left of the door) and face east.  \n   - From (5,2) (facing RIGHT), we turn LEFT to face UP.  \n   - Then we \"MOVE\" four times: going from (5,2) to (4,2), then to (3,2), (2,2), and finally to (1,2).  \n   - At (1,2) facing UP, we turn RIGHT to face east.  \n   - One \"MOVE\" brings us to (1,3).  \n   - Now, with the DOOR directly in front at (1,4), we \"UNLOCK\" it (since we hold the KEY) and then \"MOVE\" into the door cell.  \n   - Actions: \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\".\n\n4. Now inside the other room (at (1,4) facing east), we plan our path to the GOAL at (6,6). We first move east twice to reach (1,6).  \n   - Then, turning RIGHT from east sets our direction to DOWN.  \n   - Finally, we \"MOVE\" step by step: (1,6)\u21d2(2,6)\u21d2(3,6)\u21d2(4,6)\u21d2(5,6)\u21d2(6,6), where the GOAL is located.  \n   - Actions: \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\".\n\nThe full sequence of 23 actions achieves the plan."}
