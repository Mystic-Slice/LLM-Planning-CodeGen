Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nDOWN\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. Starting at [2,2] facing DOWN, the agent does \"MOVE\" to go to [3,2].\n2. Another \"MOVE\" brings the agent from [3,2] to [4,2].\n3. At [4,2] still facing DOWN, a \"LEFT\" turn reorients the agent to face EAST (toward the KEY at [4,3]).\n4. \"PICKUP\" is used to pick the KEY, which is directly to the EAST of [4,2] (located at [4,3]).\n5. With the KEY now held, \"MOVE\" takes the agent into the [4,3] cell.\n6. Still facing EAST, \"UNLOCK\" unlocks the DOOR at [4,4] (directly ahead).\n7. \"MOVE\" moves the agent into the door cell at [4,4].\n8. Another \"MOVE\" from [4,4] brings the agent further EAST to [4,5], entering the room containing the GOAL.\n9. \"RIGHT\" turns the agent from facing EAST to facing SOUTH.\n10. \"MOVE\" goes SOUTH from [4,5] to [5,5].\n11. A subsequent \"MOVE\" takes the agent from [5,5] to [6,5].\n12. \"LEFT\" adjusts orientation from SOUTH to EAST.\n13. Finally, \"MOVE\" brings the agent from [6,5] to [6,6] where the GOAL is located.\n\nThis sequence completes the objective: obtaining the KEY, unlocking the DOOR, and reaching the GOAL."}
