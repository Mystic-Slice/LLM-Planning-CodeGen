Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nRIGHT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nLet's explain the plan step by step:\n\n1. Start at (3,2) facing RIGHT. The KEY is directly under the agent at (4,2), so we first need to face DOWN. Action \"RIGHT\" turns the agent from RIGHT to DOWN.\n2. With the agent now facing DOWN, the KEY at (4,2) is in the cell directly in front. Action \"PICKUP\" picks up the KEY.\n3. Next, we need to move towards the door. We move forward: Action \"MOVE\" takes the agent from (3,2) to (4,2) (the key cell which is now empty).\n4. Another \"MOVE\" action takes the agent from (4,2) to (5,2).\n5. The DOOR is at (5,3), to the right of (5,2). Currently facing DOWN, the agent uses \"LEFT\" to turn and face RIGHT.\n6. With the door directly in front and holding the KEY, \"UNLOCK\" unlocks the door at (5,3).\n7. Now the agent \"MOVE\"s from (5,2) into the door cell (5,3).\n8. To approach the GOAL (located at (6,6)), the agent moves right into the new room: \"MOVE\" to (5,4), followed by \"MOVE\" to (5,5), and another \"MOVE\" to (5,6).\n9. Finally, since the goal is directly below (5,6), the agent turns \"RIGHT\" (from RIGHT to DOWN) and then \"MOVE\"s into the goal cell (6,6), completing the objective."}
