Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nDOWN\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n1. Starting at [3,1] facing DOWN, we first need to face UP to get toward the KEY at [2,2]. Two LEFT turns (from DOWN \u2192 RIGHT \u2192 UP) accomplish that.\n2. MOVE brings us from [3,1] to [2,1].\n3. Now, from [2,1] facing UP, a RIGHT turn rotates us to face RIGHT, which is where the KEY is located (cell [2,2]). We then PICKUP the KEY.\n4. With the key in hand, we plan a path toward the DOOR at [4,3]. We move from [2,1] to [2,2] (already on the KEY\u2019s cell, now empty).\n5. To head downwards toward the door area, we turn RIGHT (from facing RIGHT to facing DOWN) and then MOVE twice: first from [2,2] to [3,2] then [3,2] to [4,2].\n6. At [4,2] facing DOWN, a LEFT turn adjusts the facing direction to RIGHT so that the DOOR at [4,3] is directly ahead. We then UNLOCK the door.\n7. Next, we step through by MOVE into the door cell ([4,3]), and then another MOVE takes us to [4,4] still facing RIGHT.\n8. To exit the room, we turn RIGHT so we face DOWN and MOVE from [4,4] to [5,4].\n9. The GOAL is at [6,6], so from [5,4] we turn LEFT (from DOWN to RIGHT) and MOVE twice: first to [5,5] then to [5,6].\n10. Finally, a RIGHT turn (from RIGHT to DOWN) sets our direction toward the GOAL, and a MOVE takes us from [5,6] to [6,6] where the GOAL is located.\n\nThis sequence of actions completes the objective."}
