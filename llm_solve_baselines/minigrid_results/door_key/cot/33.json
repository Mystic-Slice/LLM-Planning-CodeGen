Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nLEFT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nLet's explain the plan step by step:\n\n1. Starting at (3,2) facing LEFT, we first need to go to the KEY at (2,4). To head east we must reorient. We do \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\" so that we face EAST.\n2. We \"MOVE\" from (3,2) to (3,3). Then we turn \"LEFT\" (from EAST, that makes us face NORTH) and \"MOVE\" to (2,3).\n3. Now the KEY is located immediately to our EAST (cell (2,4)), so we \"RIGHT\" to face EAST and then \"PICKUP\" the key.\n4. With the key in hand, our next goal is to head for the DOOR at (5,5), which connects the two rooms. We plan a route from (2,3) in our current room to the cell (5,4) (which is immediately left of the door). From our current facing EAST, we \"RIGHT\" to face SOUTH.\n5. We then \"MOVE\" successively to reach (3,3), (4,3), and then (5,3).\n6. From (5,3) we need to go east to (5,4). A \"LEFT\" turn (from SOUTH) makes us face EAST, then \"MOVE\" takes us to (5,4).\n7. Standing at (5,4) facing EAST (i.e. towards the door in cell (5,5)), we \"UNLOCK\" the door using the key.\n8. With the door unlocked, a \"MOVE\" carries us into the door cell (5,5). Now, we are in the second room.\n9. Finally, from (5,5) still facing EAST we \"MOVE\" into (5,6). Then a \"RIGHT\" turn (from EAST to SOUTH) allows a final \"MOVE\" from (5,6) to (6,6), where the GOAL is located.\n\nThis sequence of 18 actions fulfills the objective."}
