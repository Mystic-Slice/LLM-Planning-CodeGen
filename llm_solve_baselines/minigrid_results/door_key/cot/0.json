Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nDOWN\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the step\u2010by\u2010step reasoning:\n\n1. You start at (4,3) facing DOWN. The KEY is at (5,4), so first move down to (5,3):\n   - Action: \"MOVE\"\n\n2. Now at (5,3) facing DOWN, you need to face the KEY which is to the east. Turning LEFT from DOWN rotates you to face EAST:\n   - Action: \"LEFT\"\n\n3. With the KEY directly in front (at (5,4)), pick it up without moving into that cell:\n   - Action: \"PICKUP\"\n\n4. With the KEY in hand, you need to navigate to the door. The door at (2,5) is accessed from the left room by standing in (2,4) and facing east. First, move into the cell (5,4) (which is now empty):\n   - Action: \"MOVE\"\n\n5. Now at (5,4) facing EAST, you must head north. From EAST, a LEFT turn will face NORTH:\n   - Action: \"LEFT\"\n\n6. Move north to (4,4):\n   - Action: \"MOVE\"\n\n7. Continue north to (3,4):\n   - Action: \"MOVE\"\n\n8. Continue north to (2,4), which is immediately to the left of the door:\n   - Action: \"MOVE\"\n\n9. At (2,4) you need to face the door which is to your east. Turn RIGHT (from NORTH to EAST):\n   - Action: \"RIGHT\"\n\n10. With the door directly in front and holding the KEY, unlock it:\n    - Action: \"UNLOCK\"\n\n11. Now that the door at (2,5) is unlocked, move into the door cell:\n    - Action: \"MOVE\"\n\n12. Continue moving east into cell (2,6) (now you are in the right room):\n    - Action: \"MOVE\"\n\n13. The GOAL is at (6,6) which lies to the south. Turn RIGHT from EAST to face SOUTH:\n    - Action: \"RIGHT\"\n\n14. Move south to (3,6):\n    - Action: \"MOVE\"\n\n15. Continue south to (4,6):\n    - Action: \"MOVE\"\n\n16. Continue south to (5,6):\n    - Action: \"MOVE\"\n\n17. Finally, move south into (6,6) where the GOAL is located:\n    - Action: \"MOVE\"\n\nThis sequence unlocks the door in the left room and guides you safely to the GOAL in the adjacent room."}
