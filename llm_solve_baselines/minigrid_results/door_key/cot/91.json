Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nUP\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n  [\"RIGHT\",\n   \"MOVE\",\n   \"MOVE\",\n   \"RIGHT\",\n   \"MOVE\",\n   \"MOVE\",\n   \"MOVE\",\n   \"PICKUP\",\n   \"LEFT\",\n   \"LEFT\",\n   \"MOVE\",\n   \"MOVE\",\n   \"MOVE\",\n   \"MOVE\",\n   \"RIGHT\",\n   \"UNLOCK\",\n   \"MOVE\",\n   \"MOVE\",\n   \"MOVE\",\n   \"MOVE\",\n   \"RIGHT\",\n   \"MOVE\",\n   \"MOVE\",\n   \"MOVE\",\n   \"MOVE\",\n   \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the step\u2010by\u2010step reasoning:\n\n1. Starting at [2,1] facing UP, we need to pick up the KEY at [6,3]. We plan a route through:\n   \u2022 Turn RIGHT to face east.\n   \u2022 MOVE twice to go from [2,1] \u2192 [2,2] \u2192 [2,3].\n   \u2022 Then turn RIGHT to face DOWN.\n   \u2022 MOVE three times to go from [2,3] \u2192 [3,3] \u2192 [4,3] \u2192 [5,3].  \n   At this point, the KEY at [6,3] is directly in front.\n   \u2022 Execute PICKUP to pick up the KEY.\n\n2. With the KEY in hand, we must go to the DOOR at [1,4]. To unlock the door, it is best approached from its left (cell [1,3]) facing RIGHT.\n   \u2022 Since you are at [5,3] facing DOWN after pickup, turn LEFT twice to face UP.\n   \u2022 MOVE four times to traverse from [5,3] up to [1,3].\n   \u2022 Then turn RIGHT to face EAST, putting the door (at [1,4]) directly ahead.\n   \u2022 Execute UNLOCK with the KEY in hand.\n\n3. Now that the door is unlocked, move into it and navigate to the GOAL at [6,6] (which is in the adjacent room on the right):\n   \u2022 MOVE into the door cell ([1,4]).\n   \u2022 MOVE twice to proceed from [1,4] \u2192 [1,5] \u2192 [1,6].\n   \u2022 Turn RIGHT to face DOWN.\n   \u2022 MOVE five times to go from [1,6] down to [6,6], where the GOAL is located.\n\nThis sequence of actions successfully completes the objective."}
