Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nUP\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the step\u2010by\u2010step reasoning:\n\n1. The agent starts at (4,1) facing UP. The KEY is at (1,1), which is directly above if approached from (2,1). To pick it up, the agent moves UP until it reaches (2,1) so that the KEY at (1,1) is immediately in front:\n   - Action 1: \"MOVE\" takes the agent from (4,1) to (3,1).\n   - Action 2: \"MOVE\" takes the agent from (3,1) to (2,1).\n   - Action 3: \"PICKUP\" picks up the KEY from (1,1) (directly in front when facing UP).\n\n2. Now carrying the KEY, the agent must go to the DOOR at (4,2). To approach the door from its left (so that it is directly in front), the agent goes back to (4,1):\n   - From (2,1) (facing UP), the agent needs to face DOWN. Two 90\u00b0 turns are used:\n     - Action 4: \"RIGHT\" (changes facing from UP to RIGHT).\n     - Action 5: \"RIGHT\" (changes facing from RIGHT to DOWN).\n   - Then, the agent moves downward:\n     - Action 6: \"MOVE\" from (2,1) to (3,1).\n     - Action 7: \"MOVE\" from (3,1) to (4,1).\n   - At (4,1), to face the door at (4,2) (immediately to the right), the agent turns left:\n     - Action 8: \"LEFT\" (changes facing from DOWN to RIGHT).\n\n3. With the door directly ahead and holding the KEY, the agent unlocks the door:\n   - Action 9: \"UNLOCK\" unlocks the door at (4,2).\n\n4. Next, the agent enters the door and transitions into the second room where the GOAL is:\n   - Action 10: \"MOVE\" moves from (4,1) to the door cell (4,2).\n   - Action 11: \"MOVE\" moves from (4,2) to (4,3) (entering the room beyond the door).\n\n5. In the second room, the agent navigates to the GOAL at (6,6). With the agent still facing RIGHT, it goes further:\n   - Action 12: \"MOVE\" from (4,3) to (4,4).\n   - Action 13: \"MOVE\" from (4,4) to (4,5).\n   - Action 14: \"MOVE\" from (4,5) to (4,6).\n   - At (4,6), the agent must go downward. Turning right from facing RIGHT gives a downward direction:\n     - Action 15: \"RIGHT\" (now facing DOWN).\n   - Finally:\n     - Action 16: \"MOVE\" from (4,6) to (5,6).\n     - Action 17: \"MOVE\" from (5,6) to (6,6) where the GOAL is located.\n\nThis sequence of actions picks up the KEY, unlocks the DOOR, and leads the agent to the GOAL, satisfying the objective."}
