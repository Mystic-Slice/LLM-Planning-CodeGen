Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nRIGHT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the step\u2010by\u2010step reasoning:\n\n1. Starting at (1,1) facing RIGHT, we first need to get near the KEY (located at (4,3)). Instead of stepping onto the KEY cell (which isn\u2019t allowed because objects block movement), we plan to stand in the adjacent cell (4,2) and then pick it up from there.\n   - \"MOVE\" \u2192 from (1,1) to (1,2) (still facing RIGHT).\n   - \"RIGHT\" \u2192 turn 90\u00b0 right from RIGHT to face DOWN.\n   - \"MOVE\" \u2192 from (1,2) to (2,2).\n   - \"MOVE\" \u2192 from (2,2) to (3,2).\n   - \"MOVE\" \u2192 from (3,2) to (4,2).\n\n2. Now with the agent at (4,2) facing DOWN, it must face the KEY (at (4,3), which is to its right). To do so:\n   - \"LEFT\" \u2192 from DOWN, turning left yields facing RIGHT.\n   - \"PICKUP\" \u2192 picks the KEY from (4,3) (cell in front).\n\n3. With the KEY in hand, the next step is to unlock the DOOR (located at (3,4)). We choose to approach it from the left \u2014 standing at (3,3) facing RIGHT.\n   - From (4,2) (currently facing RIGHT after pickup), we need to go up:\n     - \"LEFT\" \u2192 from RIGHT, turning left gives UP.\n     - \"MOVE\" \u2192 from (4,2) to (3,2).\n     - \"RIGHT\" \u2192 from UP, turning right gives RIGHT.\n     - \"MOVE\" \u2192 from (3,2) to (3,3).\n   - \"UNLOCK\" \u2192 unlocks the DOOR in the cell directly in front (at (3,4)).\n\n4. After unlocking the door, we pass through it into the right-hand room, then head for the GOAL (located at (6,6)):\n   - \"MOVE\" \u2192 from (3,3) to (3,4) (through the now open door).\n   - \"MOVE\" \u2192 from (3,4) to (3,5) (now inside the right room).\n   - \"RIGHT\" \u2192 from facing RIGHT, turning right gives DOWN.\n   - \"MOVE\" \u2192 from (3,5) to (4,5).\n   - \"MOVE\" \u2192 from (4,5) to (5,5).\n   - \"MOVE\" \u2192 from (5,5) to (6,5).\n   - \"LEFT\" \u2192 from DOWN, turning left gives RIGHT.\n   - \"MOVE\" \u2192 from (6,5) to (6,6) where the GOAL is located.\n\nThis sequence of moves ensures you pick up the KEY, unlock the DOOR, transition from the starting room to the goal room, and finally arrive at the GOAL."}
