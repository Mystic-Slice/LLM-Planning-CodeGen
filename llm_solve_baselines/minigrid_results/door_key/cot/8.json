Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nUP\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nLet's explain step\u2010by\u2010step what happened:\n\n1. Starting at [1,1] facing UP, we first turn RIGHT twice to face DOWN.\n2. We move forward three times:\n   \u2022 From [1,1] \u2192 [2,1]\n   \u2022 [2,1] \u2192 [3,1]\n   \u2022 [3,1] \u2192 [4,1]\n3. While at [4,1] and facing down, the KEY is in the cell directly ahead ([5,1]), so we PICKUP the KEY.\n4. Now, still at [4,1] but holding the key, we want to return toward the door. We reorient: two LEFT turns while facing down (since turning LEFT from down gives east, then LEFT again gives north/up).\n5. Now facing UP, we MOVE three times:\n   \u2022 From [4,1] \u2192 [3,1]\n   \u2022 [3,1] \u2192 [2,1]\n   \u2022 [2,1] \u2192 [1,1]\n6. At [1,1] facing UP, we need to head east toward the door. A RIGHT turn makes us face EAST.\n7. Then, two MOVEs take us:\n   \u2022 From [1,1] \u2192 [1,2]\n   \u2022 [1,2] \u2192 [1,3]\n8. From [1,3] and facing east, the DOOR is directly in front at [1,4]. So we UNLOCK the door (using our KEY).\n9. After unlocking, we MOVE into the door cell ([1,4]), and then continue east:\n   \u2022 Next MOVE: [1,4] \u2192 [1,5]\n   \u2022 Another MOVE: [1,5] \u2192 [1,6]\n10. Now we need to descend into the room containing the GOAL. Facing east, a RIGHT turn makes us face down.\n11. Finally, a sequence of five MOVEs takes us down:\n    \u2022 [1,6] \u2192 [2,6]\n    \u2022 [2,6] \u2192 [3,6]\n    \u2022 [3,6] \u2192 [4,6]\n    \u2022 [4,6] \u2192 [5,6]\n    \u2022 [5,6] \u2192 [6,6] where the GOAL is located.\n\nThis action list successfully handles picking up the key, unlocking the door, and navigating to the goal."}
