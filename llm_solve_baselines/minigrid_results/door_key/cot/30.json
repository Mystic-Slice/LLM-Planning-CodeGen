Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR` and reach a `GOAL` which is located in a different room than the one you start in.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `GOAL`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n- You must stand on the goal cell to complete the game.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"GOAL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nUP\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the step\u2010by\u2010step explanation:\n\n1. Starting at [1,1] facing UP, we must first go pick up the KEY at [5,1]. Since the KEY is directly below [4,1], we first turn so we face DOWN. Two LEFT turns (from UP, LEFT \u2192 facing LEFT; then LEFT \u2192 facing DOWN) accomplish this.\n2. We then MOVE three times: from [1,1] \u2192 [2,1] \u2192 [3,1] \u2192 [4,1]. Now the KEY is immediately in front (cell [5,1]) so we use PICKUP.\n3. After picking up the KEY, we need to return to the door at [1,2]. From our current location ([4,1] facing DOWN), we want to head UP. Two LEFT turns will change our orientation from DOWN to east then north.\n4. We then MOVE three times upward: from [4,1] \u2192 [3,1] \u2192 [2,1] \u2192 [1,1].\n5. Now, to face the DOOR (which is to the east at [1,2]), we turn RIGHT (from UP to EAST) and then perform UNLOCK (the door is directly ahead, and we are carrying the KEY).\n6. Next, we cross the doorway: a MOVE brings us from [1,1] to the door cell [1,2] (which is now unlocked) and another MOVE takes us into room2 at [1,3].\n7. In room2, the GOAL is at [6,6]. From [1,3] facing EAST, we must head to the lower right. First, a RIGHT turn points us South.\n8. We then MOVE five times down from [1,3] to reach [6,3].\n9. From there, a LEFT turn (from South to EAST) aligns us with the GOAL. Finally, three MOVEs bring us from [6,3] \u2192 [6,4] \u2192 [6,5] \u2192 [6,6] (where the GOAL is located).\n\nThis list of 25 actions achieves the objective."}
