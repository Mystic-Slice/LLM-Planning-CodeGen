Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR`.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nLEFT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\"]\n</actions> \n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n1. Starting at [3,2] facing LEFT, we first need to reorient to head toward the KEY. Since the KEY is at [4,4] and one accessible adjacent cell is [4,3] (with the KEY directly to its east), we plan our route via (3,3) then to (4,3).\n2. From facing LEFT, two RIGHT turns make us face EAST.\n3. A MOVE from [3,2] brings us to [3,3].\n4. A RIGHT turn from EAST rotates us to face SOUTH.\n5. A MOVE brings us from [3,3] to [4,3].\n6. At [4,3] facing SOUTH, we need to face EAST (so that the KEY at [4,4] is in front). A LEFT turn does that.\n7. With the KEY in [4,4] directly ahead, we use PICKUP to grab it.\n8. Now, to unlock the DOOR at [3,5], we must be adjacent to it with the door directly in front. We plan to get to [3,4] facing EAST (since the door is at [3,5]).  \n9. From [4,3] still and facing EAST, a LEFT turn rotates us to face NORTH.\n10. A MOVE takes us from [4,3] up to [3,3].\n11. A RIGHT turn from NORTH changes our facing to EAST.\n12. A MOVE takes us to [3,4] where the DOOR is directly ahead in cell [3,5].\n13. Finally, UNLOCK unlocks the DOOR using the KEY we picked up.\n\nThis sequence satisfies the game rules and achieves the objective."}
