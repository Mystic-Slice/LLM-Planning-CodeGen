Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR`.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nDOWN\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n  [\"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\"]\n</actions>\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Starting at [2,3] facing DOWN, we need to get the KEY located at [1,1]. First, turn RIGHT from DOWN to face WEST.\n2. MOVE from [2,3] to [2,2].\n3. MOVE from [2,2] to [2,1].\n4. Then, turn RIGHT to face NORTH (so the cell in front, [1,1], has the KEY).\n5. PICKUP the KEY from [1,1].\n6. Next, we must approach the DOOR at [3,5]. We plan to stand at [3,4] and face EAST so that the door is directly in front.\n7. From [2,1] (currently facing NORTH), turn RIGHT twice: first RIGHT changes direction from NORTH to EAST, second RIGHT changes from EAST to SOUTH.\n8. MOVE down from [2,1] to [3,1].\n9. Now, turn LEFT from SOUTH to face EAST.\n10. MOVE east from [3,1] to [3,2].\n11. MOVE east from [3,2] to [3,3].\n12. MOVE east from [3,3] to [3,4].\n13. Finally, with the KEY in hand and the door directly in front (at [3,5]) while facing EAST, UNLOCK the door.\n\nThis sequence of actions fulfills the objective."}
