Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR`.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nLEFT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"UNLOCK\"]\n</actions>\n\nLet's explain the reasoning step by step:\n\n1. Starting at cell (1,4) facing LEFT, performing:\n   - \"MOVE\": advances to (1,3) (still facing LEFT).\n   - \"MOVE\": advances to (1,2).\n\n2. To head south toward the key, from (1,2) facing LEFT:\n   - \"LEFT\": now facing DOWN.\n   - \"MOVE\": moves to (2,2).\n   - \"MOVE\": moves to (3,2).\n\n3. The key is located at (4,1), so from (3,2) we want to approach it from above. From (3,2) facing DOWN:\n   - \"RIGHT\": changes direction to LEFT.\n   - \"MOVE\": moves to (3,1).\n\n4. Now, standing at (3,1) facing LEFT, to be in position to pick up the key which lies in the cell directly south (at (4,1)):\n   - \"LEFT\": turns to face DOWN.\n   - \"PICKUP\": picks up the KEY from (4,1).\n\n5. Now holding the key, we need to travel to the door. The door is at (1,5), and can be unlocked from the adjacent cell at (1,4) when facing EAST. Starting at (3,1) facing DOWN:\n   - \"LEFT\": (from DOWN, a left turn faces EAST).\n   - \"MOVE\": from (3,1) to (3,2).\n   - \"MOVE\": from (3,2) to (3,3).\n   - \"MOVE\": from (3,3) to (3,4).\n\n6. From (3,4) facing EAST, we must go north:\n   - \"LEFT\": now facing NORTH.\n   - \"MOVE\": from (3,4) to (2,4).\n   - \"MOVE\": from (2,4) to (1,4).\n\n7. Finally, at (1,4) we need to face EAST so that the door at (1,5) is directly in front:\n   - \"RIGHT\": from NORTH, a right turn faces EAST.\n   - \"UNLOCK\": unlocks the door (with the KEY in hand).\n\nThus, the action list above completes the objective step by step."}
