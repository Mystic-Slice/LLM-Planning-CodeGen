Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR`.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nDOWN\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"UNLOCK\"]\n</actions>\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n1. Initially, you are at (2,4) facing DOWN. You need to face UP to go toward the KEY (located at (1,3)). So you turn \"LEFT\" then \"LEFT\" (from DOWN, LEFT gives RIGHT; then LEFT from RIGHT gives UP).\n2. With your new orientation (UP), you \"MOVE\" forward from (2,4) to (1,4).\n3. Now, to pick up the KEY which is to the left of your current cell (at (1,3)), you turn \"LEFT\" (from UP, a left turn points you LEFT).\n4. You \"PICKUP\" the KEY which is directly in front of you.\n5. Next, you need to approach the DOOR (located at (3,5)) from an adjacent cell. The plan is to move to (3,4) and then face RIGHT so that the DOOR, at (3,5), is directly in front.\n6. From your current position (1,4) facing LEFT, you turn \"LEFT\" (from LEFT, a left turn points you DOWN).\n7. You then \"MOVE\" down from (1,4) to (2,4) and \"MOVE\" again to (3,4).\n8. At (3,4) and facing DOWN, you turn \"LEFT\" (which from DOWN points you RIGHT) so that you are facing the DOOR.\n9. Finally, with the KEY in your possession and the DOOR directly in front, you \"UNLOCK\" the DOOR.\n\nThis sequence of actions satisfies the objective."}
