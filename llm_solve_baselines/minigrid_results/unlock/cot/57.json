Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR`.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nLEFT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\"]\n</actions>\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Starting at (2,1) facing LEFT. We need to get to the KEY at (2,4) which lies to our right. Since we\u2019re facing LEFT, we first turn twice to face EAST:\n   - \"LEFT\": Now facing SOUTH.\n   - \"LEFT\": Now facing EAST.\n2. With the agent now facing EAST, moving forward twice takes us closer to the KEY:\n   - \"MOVE\": From (2,1) to (2,2).\n   - \"MOVE\": From (2,2) to (2,3).\n3. The KEY is in the cell directly ahead at (2,4). We pick it up:\n   - \"PICKUP\": Picks up the KEY.\n4. Next, we need to unlock the door at (1,5). To do that, we must approach so that the DOOR lies directly in front of us. A good approach is to move to (1,4) and face EAST. Currently, the agent is at (2,3) facing EAST. We turn and move as follows:\n   - \"LEFT\": Turn from EAST to face NORTH.\n   - \"MOVE\": From (2,3) to (1,3).\n   - \"RIGHT\": Turn from NORTH to face EAST.\n   - \"MOVE\": From (1,3) to (1,4).\n5. Now that the DOOR at (1,5) is directly ahead and we are holding the KEY, we unlock the door:\n   - \"UNLOCK\": Unlocks the door.\n  \nThis sequence of moves accomplishes the objective in the 2D grid-based environment."}
