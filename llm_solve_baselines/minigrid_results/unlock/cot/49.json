Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR`.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nDOWN\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the step\u2010by\u2010step reasoning:\n\n1. Starting at (4,2) facing DOWN, the agent turns 90\u00b0 left to face RIGHT.\n2. Turns 90\u00b0 left again to face UP.\n3. \"MOVE\" upward from (4,2) to (3,2).\n4. With the agent at (3,2) facing UP, it now turns \"RIGHT\" to face RIGHT; from here the cell directly in front, (3,3), holds the KEY.\n5. \"PICKUP\" the KEY from the cell (3,3) (since the key is directly in front).\n6. Now holding the KEY, the agent \"MOVE\"s into (3,3) (this cell is now empty because the key was picked up).\n7. To head toward the door, the agent \"LEFT\" turns from RIGHT to face UP.\n8. \"MOVE\" upward from (3,3) to (2,3).\n9. \"MOVE\" upward from (2,3) to (1,3).\n10. At (1,3) facing UP, the agent turns \"RIGHT\" to face RIGHT.\n11. \"MOVE\" right from (1,3) to (1,4). Now, the door is in the cell directly in front at (1,5).\n12. Finally, \"UNLOCK\" the door at (1,5) while holding the key.\n\nThis sequence of actions ensures the key is acquired first and then used to unlock the door."}
