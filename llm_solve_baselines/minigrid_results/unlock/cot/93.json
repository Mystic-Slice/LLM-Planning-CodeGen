Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR`.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nDOWN\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\"]\n</actions>\n\nStep-by-step Explanation:\n1. Starting at (2,1) facing DOWN:\n   \u2022 \"LEFT\": Turn left to face RIGHT.\n   \u2022 \"MOVE\": Step into (2,2) facing RIGHT.\n2. To approach the KEY at (3,3), we position ourselves to pick it up from behind:\n   \u2022 \"RIGHT\": Turn right so that from (2,2) we are now facing DOWN.\n   \u2022 \"MOVE\": Go down to (3,2) facing DOWN.\n   \u2022 \"LEFT\": Turn left from DOWN to face RIGHT. At (3,2), the KEY is now in the cell immediately to the right, at (3,3).\n   \u2022 \"PICKUP\": Pick up the KEY.\n3. With the KEY in hand at (3,2) facing RIGHT, we head to the door at (4,5). We need to be to the left of the door and facing RIGHT to unlock it:\n   \u2022 \"RIGHT\": Turn right to change from facing RIGHT to facing DOWN.\n   \u2022 \"MOVE\": Step down to (4,2).\n   \u2022 \"LEFT\": Turn left so that we face RIGHT.\n   \u2022 \"MOVE\": Move to (4,3).\n   \u2022 \"MOVE\": Move to (4,4). Now the door at (4,5) is directly in front of us.\n   \u2022 \"UNLOCK\": Unlock the door using the KEY.\n   \nFollowing these actions navigates the agent around the grid, picking up the KEY and then unlocking the DOOR."}
