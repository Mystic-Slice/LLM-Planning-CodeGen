Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR`.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nLEFT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"UNLOCK\"]\n</actions>\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Starting at (3,4) facing LEFT, the first three \"MOVE\" commands take you left to (3,3), then (3,2), and finally (3,1).\n\n2. At (3,1), you need to pick up the KEY, which is located directly below at (4,1). Since you\u2019re facing LEFT, a \"LEFT\" turn changes your orientation from LEFT to DOWN. Now, with the key cell directly in front, you execute \"PICKUP\" to grab the KEY.\n\n3. With the KEY in hand and still at (3,1) but now facing DOWN, you need to reach a cell adjacent to the DOOR at (4,5). The plan is to go to (3,4) and then move down to (4,4) so that the DOOR will be immediately to your right. To begin, turn from DOWN to RIGHT with a \"LEFT\" turn.\n\n4. Now facing RIGHT, use three \"MOVE\" commands to travel from (3,1) to (3,2), then (3,3), and finally (3,4).\n\n5. At (3,4) facing RIGHT, you want to head downward to (4,4). A \"RIGHT\" turn from RIGHT changes your direction to DOWN. Then a \"MOVE\" places you at (4,4).\n\n6. At (4,4) facing DOWN, you must reorient to face the DOOR which is at (4,5) (to your right). A \"LEFT\" turn from DOWN rotates you to face RIGHT.\n\n7. Finally, with the door directly in front of you and holding the KEY, the \"UNLOCK\" command unlocks the DOOR.\n\nThis sequence of actions completes your objective."}
