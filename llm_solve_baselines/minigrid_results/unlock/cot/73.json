Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR`.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nRIGHT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"UNLOCK\"]\n</actions>\n\nLet's explain the reasoning step by step:\n\n1. Starting at (4,1) facing RIGHT:\n   - \"MOVE\": Advance to (4,2).\n   - \"MOVE\": Advance to (4,3).\n\n2. Turn upward to head toward the KEY (located at (1,4)):\n   - \"LEFT\": Now facing UP.\n   - \"MOVE\": Go from (4,3) to (3,3).\n   - \"MOVE\": Go from (3,3) to (2,3).\n\n3. Position to get adjacent to the KEY:\n   - \"RIGHT\": Turn to face RIGHT.\n   - \"MOVE\": Advance from (2,3) to (2,4).\n   - \"LEFT\": Turn from RIGHT to face UP. Now the KEY at (1,4) is directly in front.\n   - \"PICKUP\": Pick up the KEY.\n\n4. Navigate to the door (located at (4,5)). We need to be in an adjacent cell (choosing (4,4) so that the door is immediately to the RIGHT):\n   - From (2,4) currently facing UP, turn 180\u00b0 to face DOWN by:\n     \u2022 \"RIGHT\" (UP to RIGHT)\n     \u2022 \"RIGHT\" (RIGHT to DOWN)\n   - \"MOVE\": From (2,4) down to (3,4).\n   - \"MOVE\": From (3,4) down to (4,4).\n\n5. Finally, face the door and unlock it:\n   - \"LEFT\": Turn from DOWN to face RIGHT (door is now directly ahead at (4,5)).\n   - \"UNLOCK\": Use the KEY to unlock the door.\n\nThis sequence accomplishes the objective."}
