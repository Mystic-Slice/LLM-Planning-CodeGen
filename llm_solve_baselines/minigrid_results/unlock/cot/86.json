Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR`.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nRIGHT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\"]\n</actions>\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Starting at cell [4,3] facing RIGHT, we first need to reach the KEY at cell [1,1]. To do that, we turn LEFT to face UP.\n2. We MOVE upward three times (to [3,3], then [2,3], then [1,3]).\n3. At [1,3] we now want to approach the KEY from its right side. Turning LEFT from UP brings us to face LEFT.\n4. MOVE from [1,3] to [1,2]. Now the cell directly in front ([1,1]) contains the KEY.\n5. PICKUP the KEY.\n6. With the KEY in hand, we need to reach the DOOR located in the other room at cell [4,5]. From our current location [1,2] facing LEFT, we turn LEFT to face DOWN.\n7. MOVE downward three times to reach [4,2] (passing through [2,2] and [3,2]).\n8. Now, we need to move right toward the door\u2019s vicinity. Facing DOWN, a LEFT turn changes our heading to RIGHT.\n9. MOVE right twice: first to [4,3] and then to [4,4]. Now, with the DOOR at [4,5] directly in front,\n10. Finally, perform UNLOCK to unlock the door with the KEY.\n\nThis sequence satisfies all the rules and reaches the objective."}
