Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR`.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nRIGHT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"UNLOCK\"]\n</actions>\n\nLet's explain the solution step by step:\n\n1. Starting at (3,1) facing RIGHT, we first need to pick up the KEY at (1,3). We plan to pick it up from (2,3) facing UP so that the key is directly in the adjacent cell above.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 \"MOVE\" \u2192 from (3,1) to (3,2) (facing RIGHT).\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 \"MOVE\" \u2192 from (3,2) to (3,3) (facing RIGHT).\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 \"LEFT\" \u2192 turn from RIGHT to UP.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 \"MOVE\" \u2192 from (3,3) to (2,3) (facing UP).\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 \"PICKUP\" \u2192 picks up the KEY from the cell (1,3) which is directly ahead.\n\n2. Now holding the KEY at (2,3) (still facing UP), we need to get to the DOOR at (4,5). The best approach is to unlock the door by standing at (4,4) facing RIGHT (since (4,5) contains the door).\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\" \u2192 turn from UP to DOWN (two 90\u00b0 turns; here two LEFT commands suffice: UP \u2192 LEFT \u2192 DOWN).\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 \"MOVE\" \u2192 from (2,3) to (3,3) (facing DOWN).\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 \"LEFT\" \u2192 turn from DOWN to RIGHT (so we can move eastward).\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 \"MOVE\" \u2192 from (3,3) to (3,4) (facing RIGHT).\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 \"RIGHT\" \u2192 turn from RIGHT to DOWN (so we can go down).\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 \"MOVE\" \u2192 from (3,4) to (4,4) (facing DOWN).\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 \"LEFT\" \u2192 turn from DOWN to RIGHT (to face the door).\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 \"UNLOCK\" \u2192 unlocks the DOOR at (4,5), which is directly ahead.\n\nThis sequence of actions leads from the starting position, collects the KEY, and finally unlocks the DOOR."}
