Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR`.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nRIGHT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"UNLOCK\"]\n</actions>\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. You start at row 2, column 3 facing RIGHT. The KEY is at row 1, column 1. To pick it up, you need to be adjacent to it with the key cell directly in front. One way is to get to row 2, column 1 and face UP.\n2. From the starting position:\n   - \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\": Turning twice changes your facing from RIGHT to LEFT.\n   - \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\": Moving two steps left takes you from column 3 to column 1 (position now is [2][1], facing LEFT).\n   - \"RIGHT\": Turning right from LEFT makes you face UP.\n3. Now, the cell directly in front (row 1, column 1) contains the KEY. The \"PICKUP\" action retrieves it.\n4. With the key in hand, your next goal is to unlock the door located at row 3, column 5. To unlock the door, you should stand at row 3, column 4 (the cell immediately left of the door) and face RIGHT.\n5. From your current position ([2][1] facing UP):\n   - \"RIGHT\": Turn to face RIGHT (from UP).\n   - \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\": Move eastward from [2][1] to [2][2], then [2][3], then [2][4].\n   - \"RIGHT\": From facing RIGHT, a right turn makes you face DOWN.\n   - \"MOVE\": Move down from [2][4] to [3][4].\n   - \"LEFT\": Turn left from DOWN to face RIGHT.\n6. Now, with the door directly in front ([3][5]) and holding the KEY, the \"UNLOCK\" action will unlock the door.\n\nThis sequence satisfies the objective using the allowed actions."}
