Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR`.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nUP\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the reasoning step by step:\n\n1. You start at (4,2) facing UP. The KEY is at (1,3), so you need to get adjacent to it. A good plan is to position yourself at (2,3) facing UP (so that the cell immediately in front, (1,3), contains the KEY).\n2. From (4,2) facing UP:\n   - \"MOVE\" brings you to (3,2).\n   - \"MOVE\" takes you to (2,2).\n3. You now need to shift right to column 3. So:\n   - \"RIGHT\" turns you to face RIGHT.\n   - \"MOVE\" moves you from (2,2) to (2,3).\n4. To pick up the KEY which sits at (1,3), you need to face UP:\n   - \"LEFT\" changes your direction from RIGHT to UP.\n   - \"PICKUP\" picks up the KEY in the cell (1,3) (directly in front of you).\n5. With the KEY in hand, now head to the door at (4,5). The best adjacent position for unlocking is (4,4) facing RIGHT (since (4,5) is directly in front).\n6. From (2,3) facing UP:\n   - \"RIGHT\" (first turn) and then another \"RIGHT\" turn (now facing DOWN) will orient you in the needed direction to move downward.\n   - \"MOVE\" goes from (2,3) to (3,3).\n   - \"MOVE\" further brings you to (4,3).\n7. Now adjust your direction to face RIGHT:\n   - \"LEFT\" (while facing DOWN) turns you to face RIGHT.\n   - \"MOVE\" takes you from (4,3) to (4,4).\n8. Finally, with the door at (4,5) directly in front and holding the KEY, \"UNLOCK\" opens the door.\n\nEach action was chosen to respect the rule that objects must only be interacted with when they are directly in front of you, ensuring a valid route to unlock the door.\n\nThis sequence meets the objective step-by-step."}
