Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR`.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nLEFT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"UNLOCK\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the step\u2010by\u2010step explanation:\n\n1. Starting at (1,4) facing LEFT, the cell in front is (1,3). A MOVE takes you to (1,3).\n2. Another MOVE from (1,3) (still facing LEFT) takes you to (1,2). Now, with you still facing LEFT, the cell directly in front (i.e., (1,1)) contains the KEY.\n3. Use PICKUP to grab the KEY from (1,1). (Remember that you pick up from the cell directly ahead, not by moving into the cell.)\n4\u20135. You're at (1,2) facing LEFT but now need to head rightwards (towards column 3, then column 4, etc.) to later reach the door. Since turning 180\u00b0 is needed, you perform two LEFT turns (alternatively two RIGHT turns would work) to face EAST.\n6. MOVE from (1,2) facing EAST takes you to (1,3).\n7. Another MOVE positions you at (1,4).\n8. Now, from (1,4) facing EAST, you need to travel downward toward the door. A RIGHT turn changes your facing direction from EAST to SOUTH.\n9. MOVE from (1,4) facing SOUTH goes to (2,4).\n10. Another MOVE takes you to (3,4) facing SOUTH.\n11. One more MOVE puts you at (4,4) facing SOUTH.\n12. To approach the DOOR (located at (4,5)), you must be facing it. Since the door is to your right at (4,5) when standing at (4,4), a single LEFT turn (from SOUTH to EAST) sets you up.\n13. Finally, with the door directly in front and the KEY held, UNLOCK opens the DOOR.\n\nThis sequence successfully picks up the KEY and unlocks the DOOR."}
