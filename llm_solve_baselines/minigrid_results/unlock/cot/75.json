Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR`.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nRIGHT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\"]\n</actions>\n\nLet's explain the reasoning step by step:\n\n1. Starting at [2,3] facing RIGHT, the KEY is located at [4,2] (directly below and to the left). To head toward the KEY we first need to go DOWN. From RIGHT, a \"RIGHT\" turn makes you face DOWN.\n2. \"MOVE\" advances you from [2,3] to [3,3].\n3. Now from [3,3] facing DOWN, you want to go WEST (to be adjacent to the KEY coming from the north). From DOWN, a \"RIGHT\" turn makes you face WEST.\n4. \"MOVE\" takes you from [3,3] to [3,2].\n5. To pick up the KEY, you need to be adjacent with your facing cell pointing to it. The KEY is at [4,2] (directly south of [3,2]). From WEST, a \"LEFT\" turn turns you to face SOUTH.\n6. \"PICKUP\" grabs the KEY from the cell [4,2] (which is directly in front, i.e. SOUTH of [3,2]).\n7. With the KEY in hand, your next goal is to move to a cell from which you can unlock the DOOR. The DOOR is at [3,5] and an adjacent safe cell is [3,4]. You are currently at [3,2] facing SOUTH. To head east, from SOUTH a \"LEFT\" turn directs you to face EAST.\n8. \"MOVE\" moves you from [3,2] to [3,3].\n9. \"MOVE\" moves you from [3,3] to [3,4]. Now you are adjacent to the DOOR.\n10. \"UNLOCK\" unlocks the door at [3,5] (directly in front of you) while you hold the KEY.\n\nThis sequence of actions fulfills the objective."}
