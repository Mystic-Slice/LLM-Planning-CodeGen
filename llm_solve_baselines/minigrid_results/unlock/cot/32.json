Your objective is to unlock a `DOOR`.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up.\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nLEFT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"UNLOCK\"]\n</actions>\n\nLet's explain the reasoning step by step:\n\n1. You start at cell (1,1) facing LEFT. Since the KEY is located at (2,2), you first need to reposition.\n2. By turning \"RIGHT\" twice, you change your facing from LEFT \u2192 UP \u2192 RIGHT. This lets you move right into cell (1,2).\n3. Facing RIGHT at (1,2), you then turn \"RIGHT\" again to face DOWN. Now the cell directly in front (2,2) has the KEY.\n4. You execute \"PICKUP\" to grab the KEY.\n5. Now, with the KEY in hand, you navigate to a position adjacent to the DOOR (which is located at (4,5)). The plan is to stand in cell (4,4) and face RIGHT.\n6. From (1,2) (facing down), you \"MOVE\" to (2,2) and then \"MOVE\" again to (3,2).\n7. At (3,2) facing down, a \"LEFT\" turn changes your orientation to RIGHT.\n8. Two \"MOVE\" actions take you from (3,2) \u2192 (3,3) \u2192 (3,4).\n9. From (3,4) facing RIGHT, a \"RIGHT\" turn makes you face DOWN.\n10. A \"MOVE\" brings you from (3,4) down to (4,4).\n11. Finally, turning \"LEFT\" from DOWN gives you a RIGHT orientation, perfectly aligning you with the DOOR at (4,5).\n12. With the KEY in hand and facing the door, you execute \"UNLOCK\" to open the door.\n\nThis sequence of actions meets the objective of picking up the KEY and unlocking the DOOR."}
