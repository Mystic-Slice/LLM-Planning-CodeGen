Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nRIGHT\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n[\"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"DROP\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. Starting at (1,1) facing RIGHT, the KEY is at (1,4). So first, move twice to go from (1,1) \u2192 (1,2) \u2192 (1,3). Now, with the agent facing RIGHT, the cell in front (1,4) contains the KEY.\n2. Execute \"PICKUP\" to pick up the KEY.\n3. Then, move forward (\"MOVE\") to position (1,4) so the agent is adjacent to the DOOR at (1,5).\n4. With the KEY in hand and door in front, \"UNLOCK\" the door.\n5. The agent is still holding the KEY, but to pick up the BOX later the agent must not be holding anything. To deposit the KEY safely without blocking the door passage, the agent turns around. From facing RIGHT, two \"LEFT\" commands reorient the agent to face LEFT (so that the adjacent cell (1,3) is used).\n6. \"DROP\" the KEY in (1,3) (an empty cell in the left room).\n7. Now, the agent must head through the unlocked door to enter the box\u2019s room. The agent reorients back to facing RIGHT by issuing two \"RIGHT\" turns.\n8. \"MOVE\" brings the agent from (1,4) into the door cell (1,5).\n9. Then, successive \"MOVE\" commands take the agent to (1,6), (1,7), and (1,8) so that the BOX at (1,9) is immediately in front.\n10. Finally, \"PICKUP\" picks up the BOX.\n\nThis sequence meets all the rules of the environment."}
