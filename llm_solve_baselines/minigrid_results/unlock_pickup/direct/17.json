Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nLEFT\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n[\"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. Starting at (3,2) facing LEFT, the KEY is at (2,1). The easiest adjacent cell to use for picking up the KEY is (3,1) because if you stand there and face UP, the cell in front, (2,1), contains the KEY.\n   - \"MOVE\": From (3,2) facing LEFT, move to (3,1).\n   - \"RIGHT\": Turn right (from LEFT to UP) so that (2,1) is in front.\n   - \"PICKUP\": Picks up the KEY from (2,1).\n\n2. Now holding the KEY, you must unlock the DOOR at (3,5) to enter the room with the BOX. Being in the left room at (3,1), you move east:\n   - \"RIGHT\": From facing UP, turn right (to face RIGHT).\n   - \"MOVE\": Go from (3,1) to (3,2).\n   - \"MOVE\": Go from (3,2) to (3,3).\n   - \"MOVE\": Go from (3,3) to (3,4).\n   - \"UNLOCK\": With the KEY in hand and facing RIGHT, unlock the DOOR at (3,5).\n\n3. After unlocking, proceed into the right room and navigate to a cell adjacent to the BOX (located at (2,9)). Approaching from directly below is easiest:\n   - \"MOVE\": From (3,4) to (3,5) (the unlocked door cell, now passable).\n   - \"MOVE\": Go from (3,5) to (3,6).\n   - \"MOVE\": Go from (3,6) to (3,7).\n   - \"MOVE\": Go from (3,7) to (3,8).\n   - \"MOVE\": Go from (3,8) to (3,9).\n\n4. To pick up the BOX (located at (2,9)), adjust your direction:\n   - \"LEFT\": Turn left so that your facing direction changes from RIGHT to UP (making (2,9) directly in front).\n   - \"PICKUP\": Pick up the BOX from (2,9).\n\nThis sequence of actions successfully collects the KEY, unlocks the door, enters the room with the BOX, and picks up the BOX."}
