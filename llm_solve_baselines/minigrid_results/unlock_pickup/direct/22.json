Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nRIGHT\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n[\"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. Starting at (1,1) facing RIGHT, the KEY is at (3,3). Since you may not step into a cell with an object, you must position yourself adjacent and then use PICKUP. So:\n   - \"MOVE\" takes you from (1,1) to (1,2).\n   - \"RIGHT\" rotates you from facing RIGHT to facing DOWN.\n   - \"MOVE\" moves you from (1,2) down to (2,2).\n   - \"MOVE\" moves you from (2,2) down to (3,2).\n   - \"LEFT\" rotates you from DOWN to RIGHT so that (3,3) (where the KEY is) lies directly ahead.\n   - \"PICKUP\" picks up the KEY from (3,3).\n\n2. Next you must reach the DOOR at (4,5) to unlock it. To stand at (4,4) facing RIGHT (with the door directly in front):\n   - \"RIGHT\" turns you from facing RIGHT to facing DOWN.\n   - \"MOVE\" moves you from (3,2) down to (4,2).\n   - \"LEFT\" rotates you from DOWN to RIGHT.\n   - \"MOVE\" moves you from (4,2) to (4,3).\n   - \"MOVE\" moves you from (4,3) to (4,4).\n   - \"UNLOCK\" unlocks the DOOR at (4,5) while you are holding the KEY.\n   - \"MOVE\" enters the now-unlocked DOOR cell at (4,5).\n\n3. Finally, navigate in the right room to pick up the BOX at (1,8). The best approach is to position yourself at (1,7) facing RIGHT so that the BOX is directly in front:\n   - \"MOVE\" from (4,5) to (4,6) (moving right deeper into the right room).\n   - \"LEFT\" rotates you from RIGHT to UP.\n   - \"MOVE\" moves you from (4,6) to (3,6).\n   - \"MOVE\" moves you from (3,6) to (2,6).\n   - \"MOVE\" moves you from (2,6) to (1,6).\n   - \"RIGHT\" rotates you from UP to RIGHT.\n   - \"MOVE\" moves you from (1,6) to (1,7).\n   - \"PICKUP\" picks up the BOX from (1,8).\n\nThis sequence of actions satisfies the rules and accomplishes the goal of obtaining the BOX from the other room."}
