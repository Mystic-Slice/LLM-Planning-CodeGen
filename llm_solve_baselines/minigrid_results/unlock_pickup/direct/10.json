Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nUP\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n[\"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"LEFT\", \"DROP\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere\u2019s the reasoning:\n\n1. Starting at (2,4) facing UP. We need to pick up the KEY, which is in the cell (3,4), directly \u201cbelow.\u201d Since the action PICKUP works on the cell immediately in front, we first turn from UP to DOWN by doing \u201cRIGHT\u201d then \u201cRIGHT.\u201d\n2. With the agent now facing DOWN, the cell in front ((3,4)) holds the KEY. We execute \u201cPICKUP\u201d (the agent remains at (2,4) but now is holding the KEY).\n3. Next we need to get to the door so we can unlock it. We plan to approach the door at (4,5) from the left by standing at (4,4) and facing RIGHT. To get there from (2,4), the agent moves down: first \u201cMOVE\u201d to (3,4) then \u201cMOVE\u201d to (4,4).\n4. At (4,4) facing DOWN, we want the door to be directly in front. We turn LEFT (from DOWN, left turn gives RIGHT). Now the cell in front, (4,5), is the DOOR.\n5. While holding the KEY, we \u201cUNLOCK\u201d the door.\n6. After unlocking, since the agent is still holding the KEY (and can\u2019t pick up the BOX while holding something), we drop the KEY in an adjacent empty cell. From (4,4) facing RIGHT, dropping isn\u2019t allowed into the door cell, so we turn LEFT (changing our facing from RIGHT to UP) and then \u201cDROP\u201d the KEY into (3,4) (which is empty).\n7. With an empty hand, we now reorient to re-approach the door: from (4,4) facing UP, a \u201cRIGHT\u201d turn makes us face RIGHT again.\n8. We \u201cMOVE\u201d from (4,4) into the door cell at (4,5) (which is now unlocked/empty).\n9. Next, we \u201cMOVE\u201d from (4,5) to (4,6) to enter the second room.\n10. The BOX is located at (1,6). To pick it up, we must remain outside its cell and use PICKUP on the adjacent cell. From (4,6) (facing RIGHT), we turn \u201cLEFT\u201d to face UP.\n11. We \u201cMOVE\u201d upward: first from (4,6) to (3,6), then \u201cMOVE\u201d from (3,6) to (2,6). Now the cell in front (at (1,6)) holds the BOX.\n12. Finally, we execute \u201cPICKUP\u201d to grab the BOX.\n\nThis sequence of 16 actions satisfies all constraints and achieves the goal."}
