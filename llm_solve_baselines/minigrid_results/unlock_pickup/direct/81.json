Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nRIGHT\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n[\"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Starting at (4,2) facing RIGHT, turn LEFT so you face UP.\n2. MOVE upward from (4,2) \u2192 (3,2).\n3. MOVE upward from (3,2) \u2192 (2,2).\n4. MOVE upward from (2,2) \u2192 (1,2).\n5. TURN RIGHT so you face RIGHT. Now the cell in front, (1,3), contains the KEY.\n6. Execute PICKUP to collect the KEY.\n7. Now still at (1,2) and holding the KEY, MOVE to (1,3) (the cell you just cleared).\n8. MOVE to (1,4). Standing at (1,4) facing RIGHT puts the door (at (1,5)) directly in front.\n9. Execute UNLOCK to open the DOOR at (1,5) using the KEY.\n10. MOVE into the door cell at (1,5) (now unlocked).\n11. MOVE to (1,6) which is in the room where the BOX is located.\n12. TURN RIGHT so that you face DOWN; the cell in front (2,6) now is where the BOX is.\n13. Execute PICKUP to grab the BOX.\n\nThis sequence completes your objective of retrieving the BOX from the other room."}
