Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nLEFT\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n[\"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"LEFT\", \"DROP\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nLet me explain the reasoning:\n\n1. Starting at (4,1) facing LEFT, we first turn RIGHT so we face UP.\n2. We MOVE to (3,1). Then we turn RIGHT so that we face RIGHT.\n3. Two MOVEs bring us from (3,1) to (3,2) then (3,3). Now the cell to our right ((3,4)) holds the KEY.\n4. We execute PICKUP to grab the KEY.\n5. To head to the door in room1 (with the KEY in hand), we turn LEFT (from facing RIGHT, LEFT makes us face UP) and MOVE to (2,3).\n6. Turning RIGHT (facing from UP to RIGHT) puts us in position so that a MOVE takes us from (2,3) to (2,4) with the door directly ahead at (2,5). \n7. We use UNLOCK to open that door while holding the KEY.\n8. Now that the KEY has served its purpose (we only need it to unlock), and since we cannot pick up the BOX while holding something, we need to drop the KEY. At (2,4) facing RIGHT the drop cell (the one in front) would be (2,5)\u2014but that\u2019s the door cell (and dropping into a DOOR cell is not allowed). So instead, we turn LEFT (so we face UP) making the drop cell become (1,4), which is empty.\n9. We perform DROP to leave the KEY behind.\n10. Reorienting by turning RIGHT (so now we face RIGHT again), we MOVE into the door cell (2,5), now in room2.\n11. In room2 we continue by moving from (2,5) to (2,6). Then we turn RIGHT to face DOWN.\n12. Two MOVEs take us down from (2,6) to (3,6) and then to (4,6).\n13. At (4,6) facing DOWN, we turn LEFT to face RIGHT.\n14. Two MOVEs then bring us from (4,6) to (4,7) and then to (4,8). Here, the BOX is located immediately to our right at (4,9).\n15. We finish by executing PICKUP to grab the BOX.\n\nThis sequence satisfies all the movement, door unlocking, and drop/pickup rules."}
