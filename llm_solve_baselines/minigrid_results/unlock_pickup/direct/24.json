Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nLEFT\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n    [\"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"DROP\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. Starting at (3,3) facing LEFT, turn RIGHT to face UP.\n2. With the KEY located at (2,3) (directly in front when facing UP), perform PICKUP.\n3. MOVE from (3,3) to (2,3).\n4. Turn RIGHT (from UP to RIGHT) to head toward the door.\n5. MOVE from (2,3) to (2,4) so that the DOOR (at (2,5)) is directly in front.\n6. UNLOCK the DOOR (while holding the KEY) at (2,5).\n7. MOVE into the door cell at (2,5).\n8. MOVE right to (2,6).\n9. MOVE right to (2,7).\n10. MOVE right to (2,8). (Now the BOX at (2,9) is directly in front; however, you're still holding the KEY.)\n11. To be allowed to pick up the BOX, change direction: turn LEFT from RIGHT to face UP.\n12. DROP the KEY into the adjacent cell in front (cell (1,8) is empty).\n13. Turn RIGHT (from UP to RIGHT) to face the BOX again.\n14. Finally, PICKUP the BOX located at (2,9).\n\nThis sequence fulfills the objective while obeying all game rules."}
