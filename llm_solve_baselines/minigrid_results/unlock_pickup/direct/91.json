Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nRIGHT\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n[\"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"LEFT\", \"DROP\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the explanation of the plan:\n\n1. The agent starts at (1,3) facing RIGHT. To get to the KEY at (4,1) (which is in the same room) the agent reorients downward and then travels to an adjacent cell so that the KEY is directly in front.\n   - \"RIGHT\" turns the agent to face DOWN.\n   - Three \"MOVE\" commands bring the agent from (1,3) to (4,3).\n   - \"RIGHT\" reorients the agent to face WEST.\n   - \"MOVE\" brings the agent to (4,2), which places the cell (4,1) (holding the KEY) directly in front.\n   - \"PICKUP\" picks up the KEY.\n\n2. Next, the agent must unlock the door to reach the other room containing the BOX. The door is at (3,5) in the wall between the two rooms; it must be unlocked using the KEY.\n   - From (4,2) facing WEST, \"RIGHT\" turns the agent to face NORTH.\n   - \"MOVE\" goes from (4,2) to (3,2).\n   - \"RIGHT\" turns the agent to face EAST.\n   - Two \"MOVE\" commands drive the agent from (3,2) to (3,3) and then to (3,4). Now the door (at (3,5)) is directly in front.\n   - \"UNLOCK\" uses the KEY to unlock the door.\n     \n3. Since the agent cannot hold two items at once and the objective is to pick up the BOX, the agent must drop the KEY before picking up the BOX. In (3,4) the agent can drop the KEY into an adjacent empty cell.\n   - \"LEFT\" turns the agent to face NORTH (so that the cell (2,4) is in front, which is empty).\n   - \"DROP\" places the KEY at (2,4).\n   - \"RIGHT\" reorients the agent to face EAST again.\n   - \"MOVE\" steps the agent into the now-unlocked door cell at (3,5), entering the second room.\n\n4. In room2, the BOX is at (1,9). The agent plans a route so that it comes to a cell from which the BOX (at (1,9)) is immediately in front when facing EAST.\n   - \"MOVE\" from (3,5) to (3,6) while facing EAST.\n   - \"LEFT\" turns the agent to face NORTH.\n   - Two \"MOVE\" commands bring the agent from (3,6) to (2,6) then to (1,6).\n   - \"RIGHT\" turns the agent to face EAST.\n   - Two \"MOVE\" commands from (1,6) to (1,7) then to (1,8) position the agent so that the BOX at (1,9) is directly in front.\n   - \"PICKUP\" picks up the BOX.\n\nThus, the full sequence of 25 actions achieves the objective."}
