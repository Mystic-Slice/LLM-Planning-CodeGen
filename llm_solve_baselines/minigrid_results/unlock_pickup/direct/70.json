Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nRIGHT\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n[\"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"DROP\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. Starting at (2,2) facing RIGHT, the key is at (3,4) but you cannot step into its cell. So first move to a cell adjacent to the key.\n   - \"MOVE\": from (2,2) \u2192 (2,3)\n   - \"MOVE\": from (2,3) \u2192 (2,4)\n\n2. Now at (2,4) facing RIGHT, turn to face DOWN so that the key at (3,4) is directly ahead.\n   - \"RIGHT\": now facing DOWN\n\n3. Execute \"PICKUP\" to collect the KEY from the cell in front (3,4).\n\n4. With the KEY held and still at (2,4), move into (3,4) so you can reach the door.\n   - \"MOVE\": from (2,4) \u2192 (3,4)\n\n5. The DOOR is located at (3,5). From (3,4) you must face RIGHT:\n   - \"LEFT\": from DOWN, turning left results in facing RIGHT\n\n6. With the door in front, use the KEY to unlock it.\n   - \"UNLOCK\": unlocks the door at (3,5)\n\n7. Since you cannot hold two objects at the same time (and the goal is to eventually pick up the BOX), you must drop the KEY. However, you can\u2019t drop it directly into the door cell. So, reorient to drop it into an empty cell (here, (3,3) is empty).\n   - \"LEFT\": from RIGHT \u2192 facing UP\n   - \"LEFT\": from UP \u2192 facing LEFT\n   - \"DROP\": drops the KEY into (3,3)\n\n8. Now, reorient to go through the door. From (3,4) facing LEFT, turn right twice to face RIGHT.\n   - \"RIGHT\": from LEFT \u2192 facing UP\n   - \"RIGHT\": from UP \u2192 facing RIGHT\n\n9. Proceed through the unlocked door:\n   - \"MOVE\": from (3,4) \u2192 (3,5) (the door is unlocked so it\u2019s passable)\n   - \"MOVE\": from (3,5) \u2192 (3,6)\n\n10. The BOX is in the adjacent cell (4,6). Turn to face DOWN:\n    - \"RIGHT\": from RIGHT \u2192 facing DOWN\n\n11. Finally, pick up the BOX:\n    - \"PICKUP\": from (3,6) pick up the BOX at (4,6)\n\nThis sequence meets all the movement and interaction rules and achieves the objective of picking up the BOX."}
