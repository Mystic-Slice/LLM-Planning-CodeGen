Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nRIGHT\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"DROP\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nExplanation:\n1. The agent begins at (4,2) facing RIGHT. The first step \u201cLEFT\u201d turns the agent to face UP.\n2. \u201cMOVE\u201d moves the agent from (4,2) to (3,2).\n3. \u201cLEFT\u201d then rotates the agent from UP to face LEFT so that the KEY (located at (3,1)) is directly ahead.\n4. \u201cPICKUP\u201d picks up the KEY.\n5. \u201cRIGHT\u201d rotates from LEFT to UP so the agent can head north.\n6. \u201cMOVE\u201d moves the agent to (2,2).\n7. \u201cRIGHT\u201d rotates from UP to face RIGHT.\n8.\u20139. Two \u201cMOVE\u201d actions advance the agent from (2,2) to (2,3) and then to (2,4). The door is at (2,5) (directly to the RIGHT of (2,4)).\n10. \u201cUNLOCK\u201d uses the KEY (which the agent is holding) to unlock the DOOR at (2,5).\n11. \u201cMOVE\u201d moves the agent into the door cell (2,5) in the other room.\n\u2028\nImportant \u2013 the rules prevent picking up a new object while holding one. Thus before picking up the BOX (located at (2,6)), the agent must drop the KEY.\n12.\u201313. Two \u201cLEFT\u201d actions reorient the agent from facing RIGHT to facing LEFT (via UP) so that the cell in front\u2014(2,4)\u2014is empty.\n14. \u201cDROP\u201d drops the KEY into (2,4).\n15.\u201316. Two \u201cRIGHT\u201d actions now reorient the agent from facing LEFT to facing RIGHT, so that the BOX (at (2,6)) is directly in front.\n17. \u201cPICKUP\u201d then picks up the BOX.\n\nThis sequence safely collects the KEY to unlock the door, leaves the KEY behind (since only one object may be held at a time), enters the room with the BOX, and finally picks up the BOX."}
