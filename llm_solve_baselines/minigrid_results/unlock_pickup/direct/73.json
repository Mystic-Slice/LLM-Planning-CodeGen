Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nRIGHT\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n[\"LEFT\", \"LEFT\",\n \"MOVE\",\n \"LEFT\",\n \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\",\n \"RIGHT\",\n \"MOVE\",\n \"PICKUP\",\n \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\",\n \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\",\n \"RIGHT\",\n \"MOVE\",\n \"LEFT\",\n \"UNLOCK\",\n \"MOVE\",\n \"MOVE\",\n \"LEFT\",\n \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\",\n \"RIGHT\",\n \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\",\n \"RIGHT\",\n \"DROP\",\n \"LEFT\",\n \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions> \n\nExplanation:\n1. From the start at (1,4) facing RIGHT, we first turn twice (\"LEFT\", \"LEFT\") so that we face LEFT. Then we MOVE from (1,4) to (1,3).  \n2. To head toward the KEY at (3,1), we turn left (from LEFT, a left turn changes our heading to SOUTH) and MOVE twice \u2013 first to (2,3) then to (3,3).  \n3. At (3,3) facing SOUTH, we turn right to face WEST and MOVE to (3,2). Now the KEY is immediately to our left (cell (3,1)), so we PICKUP the KEY.  \n4. With the KEY in hand, we need to get to the door at (4,5). At (3,2) facing WEST, we turn twice (\"LEFT\", \"LEFT\") to reverse our direction to EAST. Then we MOVE from (3,2) to (3,3) and again to (3,4).  \n5. From (3,4) facing EAST, we turn RIGHT to face SOUTH and MOVE to (4,4). At (4,4) facing SOUTH, a LEFT turn makes us face EAST \u2013 directly toward the door at (4,5). We then UNLOCK the door and MOVE into the cell (4,5).  \n6. Now in the second room (with the BOX at (1,9)), we must travel to a spot from which we can pick the BOX. From (4,5) still facing EAST, we MOVE to (4,6). Then we turn LEFT (facing NORTH) and MOVE upward three times: from (4,6) to (3,6), then to (2,6), and finally to (1,6).  \n7. At (1,6) facing NORTH, a RIGHT turn directs us EAST. We then MOVE to (1,7) and again to (1,8).  \n8. At (1,8) facing EAST, the BOX lies in the cell in front (at (1,9)); however, since we are still holding the KEY and cannot pick up another object, we must DROP the KEY first. We turn RIGHT (so that from EAST we face SOUTH) and perform DROP \u2013 this deposits the KEY into the adjacent cell (2,8), which is empty.  \n9. Finally, a LEFT turn (from SOUTH back to EAST) sets us up to PICKUP the BOX from (1,9).\n\nThis 30\u2010action sequence satisfies the rules and leads the agent from its starting room to picking up the BOX in the other room."}
