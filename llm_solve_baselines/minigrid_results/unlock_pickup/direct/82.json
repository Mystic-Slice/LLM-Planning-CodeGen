Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nDOWN\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n[\"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. Starting at (4,3) facing DOWN, we must first get the KEY located at (1,1). An effective approach is to approach (1,1) from below so that the KEY is in the cell immediately in front of us during a PICKUP. We plan to reach cell (2,1) and face NORTH (so that (1,1) is directly ahead). The first nine actions are:\n\u2003\u2022 \"RIGHT\" \u2013 from DOWN, turning RIGHT makes you face WEST.\n\u2003\u2022 \"MOVE\" \u2013 move from (4,3) to (4,2).\n\u2003\u2022 \"RIGHT\" \u2013 from WEST, turning RIGHT makes you face NORTH.\n\u2003\u2022 \"MOVE\" \u2013 move from (4,2) to (3,2).\n\u2003\u2022 \"MOVE\" \u2013 move from (3,2) to (2,2).\n\u2003\u2022 \"LEFT\" \u2013 from NORTH, turning LEFT makes you face WEST.\n\u2003\u2022 \"MOVE\" \u2013 move from (2,2) to (2,1).\n\u2003\u2022 \"RIGHT\" \u2013 from WEST, turning RIGHT makes you face NORTH.\n\u2003\u2022 \"PICKUP\" \u2013 now the KEY in cell (1,1) (directly in front) is picked up.\n\n2. Now holding the KEY, you must cross into the right-side room to get the BOX (located at (2,9)). The door is at (3,5) (in the left room\u2019s eastern wall). To approach the door from its left, we plan a route from (2,1) to cell (3,4) facing EAST. Then:\n\u2003\u2022 \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\" \u2013 from NORTH, two RIGHT turns put you facing SOUTH.\n\u2003\u2022 \"MOVE\" \u2013 from (2,1) to (3,1).\n\u2003\u2022 \"LEFT\" \u2013 from SOUTH, a LEFT turn makes you face EAST.\n\u2003\u2022 \"MOVE\" \u2013 from (3,1) to (3,2).\n\u2003\u2022 \"MOVE\" \u2013 from (3,2) to (3,3).\n\u2003\u2022 \"MOVE\" \u2013 from (3,3) to (3,4).\n\u2003\u2022 \"UNLOCK\" \u2013 with the KEY in hand, unlock the door in the cell (3,5) which is directly ahead.\n\u2003\u2022 \"MOVE\" \u2013 enter the door cell (3,5).\n\u2003\u2022 Then proceed EAST into the right room:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 \"MOVE\" \u2192 from (3,5) to (3,6)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 \"MOVE\" \u2192 from (3,6) to (3,7)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 \"MOVE\" \u2192 from (3,7) to (3,8)\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 \"MOVE\" \u2192 from (3,8) you are still in the room.\n\u2003\u2022 Now to pick up the BOX, plan to approach it from its left. Being at (3,8) facing EAST, you need to go NORTH to get directly to a cell left of the BOX:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 \"LEFT\" \u2013 from EAST, turning LEFT makes you face NORTH.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 \"MOVE\" \u2013 move from (3,8) to (2,8).\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 \"RIGHT\" \u2013 from NORTH, turning RIGHT makes you face EAST.\n\u2003\u2022 \"PICKUP\" \u2013 with the BOX located in (2,9) (the cell immediately in front), you pick it up.\n\nThis complete series of 25 actions achieves the objective.\n\nEnjoy your win!"}
