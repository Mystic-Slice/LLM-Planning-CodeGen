Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nDOWN\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n  [\"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"DROP\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's an explanation of the plan:\n\n1. Starting at (2,4) facing DOWN, we first turn RIGHT so that we face WEST. Then we MOVE twice to go from (2,4) \u2192 (2,3) \u2192 (2,2).  \n2. From (2,2) (now facing WEST), we turn RIGHT so that we face NORTH. With the KEY at (1,2) directly ahead, we do a PICKUP to acquire the KEY.\n3. Holding the KEY, we now need to head to the door. We turn RIGHT (from NORTH to EAST) and MOVE twice: from (2,2) \u2192 (2,3) then (2,3) \u2192 (2,4). Next, we turn RIGHT to face SOUTH and MOVE twice downward: (2,4) \u2192 (3,4) and (3,4) \u2192 (4,4).  \n4. At (4,4) we want to unlock the door at (4,5). We turn LEFT (from SOUTH to EAST) and then perform UNLOCK while the door cell (4,5) is directly ahead.\n5. We still hold the KEY, but to pick up the BOX later we must release it. We reorient so the drop cell isn\u2019t in the corridor to the BOX. From (4,4) (facing EAST), we turn LEFT twice to face WEST (this positions the drop cell at (4,3), which is empty and safe). We then DROP the KEY.\n6. Now, to head into the box room without the burden of the KEY blocking our new goal, we turn 180\u00b0 (by turning LEFT twice) from WEST back to EAST. Then we MOVE forward into the unlocked door cell (4,5) and continue eastward through cells (4,6), (4,7), and (4,8).\n7. Finally, at (4,8) facing EAST the BOX is directly in front at (4,9); we execute PICKUP to collect the BOX and complete our objective.\n\nThis sequence of 23 actions completes the mission as required."}
