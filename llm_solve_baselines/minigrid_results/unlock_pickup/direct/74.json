Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nRIGHT\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n  [\"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"DROP\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nLet me explain the plan:\n\n1. At the start the AGENT is at (2,3) facing RIGHT. The KEY is located at (3,3), which is directly below. So first the agent turns RIGHT to face DOWN and then uses PICKUP to grab the KEY without moving into that cell (since objects block movement).\n\n2. Now holding the KEY, the agent needs to approach the door at (1,5) (which connects the two rooms). The agent navigates from (2,3) to (1,4) by first turning LEFT (from DOWN to RIGHT), moving to (2,4), then turning LEFT again to face UP, and moving one cell up to (1,4). A subsequent RIGHT turn reorients the agent to face the door (cell (1,5)), allowing the use of UNLOCK.\n\n3. After unlocking, the agent moves into the door cell and then steps further into the right-hand room. A MOVE puts it from (1,5) to (1,6).\n\n4. To reach the BOX at (4,9), the agent turns RIGHT (changing direction to DOWN) and makes a series of MOVE actions: from (1,6) \u2192 (2,6) \u2192 (3,6) \u2192 (4,6). Then the agent turns LEFT to face RIGHT and moves two steps from (4,6) to (4,7) and then to (4,8).\n\n5. At (4,8) facing RIGHT the BOX occupies the cell directly in front (4,9), but the agent is still holding the KEY (and can hold only one object at a time). So the agent needs to drop the KEY first. To drop it in an empty cell, the agent reorients so that the adjacent cell (back to (4,7), which is now empty) becomes its drop target. This is done by turning RIGHT twice (from facing RIGHT to facing LEFT) and then executing DROP.\n\n6. Finally, the agent turns around again (with two LEFT turns) to face RIGHT so that (4,9) with the BOX is in front, and then uses PICKUP to grab the BOX.\n\nThis sequence of 23 actions accomplishes the objective."}
