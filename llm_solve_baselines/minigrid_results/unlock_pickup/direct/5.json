Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nRIGHT\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n[\"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"LEFT\", \"DROP\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions> \n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. Starting at (4,3) facing RIGHT, we first need to get the KEY from (3,2).  \n   \u2022 \"LEFT\" turns our facing to UP.  \n   \u2022 \"MOVE\" takes us from (4,3) to (3,3).  \n   \u2022 \"LEFT\" turns us from UP to LEFT.  \n   \u2022 \"PICKUP\" picks up the KEY located in the cell directly in front ((3,2)).\n\n2. Now holding the KEY, we must go unlock the door at (3,5). We are at (3,3) facing LEFT, so we must change direction:  \n   \u2022 \"RIGHT\" then \"RIGHT\" rotates us 180\u00b0 (from LEFT \u2192 UP \u2192 RIGHT).  \n   \u2022 \"MOVE\" advances us from (3,3) to (3,4).  \n   \u2022 \"UNLOCK\" unlocks the door in the cell in front ((3,5)).\n\n3. Before picking up the BOX later, we must not be holding anything. Since we don't need the KEY anymore, we drop it\u2014but not into the door cell. At (3,4) facing RIGHT, the cell in front is (3,5) (a door) which is illegal for a drop.  \n   \u2022 \"LEFT\" rotates us so we face UP.  \n   \u2022 \"DROP\" now deposits the KEY into the cell (2,4) (an empty cell).\n\n4. We now want to enter the right-hand room through the unlocked door and navigate to the BOX at (1,8). From (3,4) facing UP:  \n   \u2022 \"RIGHT\" rotates us to face RIGHT.  \n   \u2022 \"MOVE\" moves us into the door cell (3,5).  \n   \u2022 \"MOVE\" advances us to (3,6) in the right room.\n\n5. Navigating to the BOX:  \n   \u2022 \"LEFT\" from (3,6) changes our facing from RIGHT to UP.  \n   \u2022 Two \"MOVE\" actions take us upward from (3,6) to (2,6) then to (1,6).  \n   \u2022 \"RIGHT\" rotates us to face RIGHT at (1,6).  \n   \u2022 \"MOVE\" takes us from (1,6) to (1,7).\n\n6. Finally, standing at (1,7) facing RIGHT, the BOX is directly ahead in (1,8):  \n   \u2022 \"PICKUP\" grabs the BOX, meeting our objective.\n   \nThis sequence gets you the KEY in the starting room, uses it to unlock the door to the BOX\u2019s room, drops the KEY (so you can pick up the BOX), and then navigates to pick up the BOX."}
