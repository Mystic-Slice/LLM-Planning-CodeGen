Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nRIGHT\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n[\"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"DROP\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nExplanation:\n1. Starting at (1,2) facing RIGHT, the agent first turns RIGHT to face DOWN.\n2. \"MOVE\" takes the agent from (1,2) to (2,2).\n3. With the agent at (2,2) facing DOWN, the adjacent cell (3,2) holds the KEY, so \"PICKUP\" collects it.\n4. To head toward the door, the agent (holding the KEY at (2,2) facing DOWN) turns LEFT to face RIGHT.\n5.\u20136. Two \"MOVE\" actions take the agent from (2,2) to (2,3) and then to (2,4).\n7. At (2,4) facing RIGHT, the agent turns RIGHT to face DOWN.\n8. \"MOVE\" advances the agent to (3,4).\n9. From (3,4) facing DOWN, a \"LEFT\" turn reorients the agent to face RIGHT\u2014directly toward the door in (3,5).\n10. \"UNLOCK\" uses the KEY to unlock the door located in (3,5).\n11. \"MOVE\" brings the agent into the door cell at (3,5).\n12.\u201313. Now, since the agent must be empty\u2013handed before picking up the BOX (in (3,6)), it must deposit the KEY. From (3,5) facing RIGHT (with BOX blocking (3,6)), two \"LEFT\" turns reorient the agent to face LEFT (i.e. toward the empty cell at (3,4)).\n14. \"DROP\" places the KEY into (3,4).\n15.\u201316. Two \"RIGHT\" turns reorient the agent from facing LEFT back to facing RIGHT.\n17. Finally, with (3,6) directly ahead where the BOX is located, \"PICKUP\" collects the BOX.\n\nThis sequence satisfies all the moved rules and completes the objective of picking up the BOX in the other room."}
