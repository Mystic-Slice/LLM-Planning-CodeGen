Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nUP\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n[\"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"RIGHT\", \"DROP\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nExplanation:\n1. Starting at (1,4) facing UP, the first two \"LEFT\" actions make you face DOWN.\n2. \"MOVE\" takes you from (1,4) to (2,4). Then a \"RIGHT\" turns you from DOWN to face WEST.\n3. Two \"MOVE\" actions bring you west from (2,4) to (2,3) then to (2,2).\n4. A \"LEFT\" (from WEST, left-turn gives SOUTH) sets your direction toward the KEY.\n5. \"MOVE\" takes you from (2,2) to (3,2) so that the cell in front\u2014(4,2)\u2014contains the KEY.\n6. \"PICKUP\" collects the KEY from (4,2).\n7. Now, to head to the door at (2,5), you turn around: two \"LEFT\" actions (from SOUTH to NORTH) and then \"MOVE\" from (3,2) to (2,2).\n8. A \"RIGHT\" turns you from NORTH to face EAST.\n9. Two \"MOVE\" actions take you from (2,2) to (2,3) and then to (2,4). Facing EAST, the door at (2,5) is in front.\n10. \"UNLOCK\" uses the KEY on the door.\n11. Since you can hold only one object and your goal is to pick up the BOX later, you then \"RIGHT\" turn (from EAST to face SOUTH) and \"DROP\" the KEY into the adjacent empty cell at (3,4).\n12. To approach the door again, you \"LEFT\" (from SOUTH to EAST) so that with \"MOVE\" you enter the door cell (2,5).\n13. Four consecutive \"MOVE\" actions guide you east through (2,6), (2,7), (2,8), and finally (2,9).\n14. A \"RIGHT\" turn from EAST makes you face SOUTH. \"MOVE\" takes you to (3,9) so that the BOX at (4,9) is directly in front.\n15. Finally, \"PICKUP\" collects the BOX.\n  \nThis sequence meets the objective of obtaining the BOX in the adjacent room."}
