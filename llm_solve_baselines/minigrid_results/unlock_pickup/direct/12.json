Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nDOWN\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"LEFT\", \"DROP\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nBelow is an explanation of the planned solution:\n\n1. Starting at [3,2] facing DOWN, we want to pick up the KEY at [2,2]. Since the KEY lies directly above, we first turn twice (LEFT, LEFT) so that we face UP. Then we execute \"PICKUP\" to collect the KEY from the cell in front (at [2,2]).\n\n2. Now holding the KEY (which is needed for unlocking the door), we must later drop it before picking up the BOX (since only one object can be held at a time). Our next goal is to unlock the door at [3,5]. To do that, we need to stand adjacent to the door with the door in front of us.  \n   \u2022 From [3,2] (facing UP), turning RIGHT makes us face RIGHT.  \n   \u2022 We then \"MOVE\" twice (first to [3,3] then to [3,4]) so that from [3,4] facing RIGHT, the door at [3,5] is directly in front.\n\n3. We use \"UNLOCK\" (while still holding the KEY) to unlock the door.\n\n4. Before proceeding, we must free our hands to pick up the BOX that is our objective. At [3,4] (currently facing RIGHT), we choose to drop the KEY into an adjacent empty cell. We cannot drop into the door cell, so we turn LEFT (from RIGHT to UP) so that the adjacent cell in front ([2,4]) is empty, and then \"DROP\" the KEY there.\n\n5. With empty hands, we can now cross the unlocked door:  \n   \u2022 We turn RIGHT (from UP to RIGHT) so that the door cell at [3,5] lies in front, and \"MOVE\" into it.  \n   \u2022 We \"MOVE\" again to get from [3,5] into [3,6]\u2014entering the right room where the BOX is located.\n\n6. Finally, the BOX is at [1,6]. To pick it up, we position ourselves so that the BOX is in the cell directly in front of us.  \n   \u2022 At [3,6] (facing RIGHT), we turn LEFT to face UP.  \n   \u2022 We then \"MOVE\" from [3,6] to [2,6]. Now, with us at [2,6] facing UP, the BOX at [1,6] lies in the adjacent cell in front.  \n   \u2022 We execute \"PICKUP\" to retrieve the BOX.\n\nThis sequence of 15 actions meets all the rules of the environment and achieves the goal of picking up the BOX located in a different room."}
