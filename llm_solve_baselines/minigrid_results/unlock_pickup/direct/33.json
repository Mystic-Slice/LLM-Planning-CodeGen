Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nRIGHT\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"DROP\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nExplanation:\n1. Starting at (2,3) facing RIGHT, we first turn \"LEFT\" to face UP. With the KEY at (1,3) directly ahead, we \"PICKUP\" it.\n2. To head toward the door on the left room\u2019s side (at (4,5)), we first reorient: from UP, two \"RIGHT\" turns change our direction to DOWN.\n3. Two \"MOVE\" actions bring us from (2,3) to (3,3) then to (4,3). From there, a \"LEFT\" turn (while facing DOWN) makes us face RIGHT.\n4. A \"MOVE\" puts us at (4,4) where the door is immediately to our right. We \"UNLOCK\" the door (using our held KEY) and then \"MOVE\" into the door cell (at (4,5)).\n5. Now in the right room, a \"MOVE\" takes us to (4,6). To approach the BOX at (1,6), we \"LEFT\" turn from RIGHT to face UP and then execute three moves: (4,6)\u2192(3,6) and (3,6)\u2192(2,6). (Note: We avoid moving directly into the BOX\u2019s cell since that cell is occupied.)\n6. At (2,6) we are still holding the KEY and facing UP toward the BOX at (1,6). We cannot pick up the BOX while holding the KEY. So, we \"RIGHT\" turn (now facing RIGHT) to orient toward an empty cell at (2,7) and \"DROP\" the KEY there.\n7. Finally, a \"LEFT\" turn reorients us to face UP again, putting the BOX in the cell directly ahead. We then \"PICKUP\" the BOX to complete our objective.\n"}
