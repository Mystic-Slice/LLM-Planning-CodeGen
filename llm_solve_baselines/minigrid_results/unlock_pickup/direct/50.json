Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nDOWN\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n[\"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"LEFT\", \"DROP\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nExplanation:\n1. Starting at (3,2) facing DOWN, the agent moves \u201cMOVE\u201d into (4,2).\n2. \u201cLEFT\u201d turns the agent from DOWN to RIGHT so it faces the KEY at (4,3).\n3. \u201cPICKUP\u201d grabs the KEY (since it is directly ahead at (4,3)).\n4\u20135. Two \u201cMOVE\u201d actions take the agent from (4,2) \u2192 (4,3) \u2192 (4,4).\n6. At (4,4) facing RIGHT, \u201cUNLOCK\u201d unlocks the door immediately ahead at (4,5).\n7\u20138. To free up its hand (because it cannot pick up the BOX while holding the KEY), the agent turns \u201cLEFT\u201d (clockwise from RIGHT to UP) so that an adjacent cell ((3,4)) is available, then \u201cDROP\u201ds the KEY there.\n9. \u201cRIGHT\u201d reorients the agent from UP back to RIGHT.\n10. \u201cMOVE\u201d passes through the now-unlocked door from (4,4) to (4,5).\n11\u201314. Four successive \u201cMOVE\u201d actions navigate through the right room: (4,5) \u2192 (4,6) \u2192 (4,7) \u2192 (4,8) \u2192 (4,9).\n15. At (4,9) facing RIGHT, \u201cLEFT\u201d turns the agent to face UP.\n16\u201317. Two \u201cMOVE\u201d actions move the agent upward from (4,9) to (3,9) then to (2,9).\n18. Finally, \u201cPICKUP\u201d grabs the BOX directly in front (at (1,9)) without entering its cell.\n  \nThis sequence completes the objective of retrieving the BOX from the other room."}
