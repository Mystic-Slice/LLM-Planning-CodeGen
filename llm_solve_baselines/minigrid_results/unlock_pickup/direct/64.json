Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nLEFT\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n    [\"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"LEFT\", \"DROP\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the rationale:\n\n1. Starting at (4,4) facing LEFT, the agent first moves one cell to the left (to (4,3)) with \u201cMOVE.\u201d\n2. With a \u201cRIGHT\u201d turn from facing LEFT, the agent then faces UP.\n3. Now, standing at (4,3) and facing UP, the cell immediately in front\u2014(3,3)\u2014contains the KEY, so \u201cPICKUP\u201d picks it up.\n4. Next, the agent \u201cMOVE\u201ds from (4,3) into (3,3) (the cell where the KEY was, now empty since it has been picked up).\n5. To head toward the door, the agent turns \u201cRIGHT\u201d so that from (3,3) it faces RIGHT.\n6. \u201cMOVE\u201d takes the agent from (3,3) to (3,4). Now the cell directly in front, (3,5), is the DOOR.\n7. Holding the KEY, the agent \u201cUNLOCK\u201ds the DOOR at (3,5).\n8. The agent then turns \u201cLEFT\u201d (from RIGHT to UP) so an empty cell (2,4) is immediately in front.\n9. With \u201cDROP,\u201d the agent disposes of the KEY in (2,4) to free up its hands.\n10. After turning \u201cRIGHT\u201d (from UP to RIGHT) while remaining at (3,4), the door (now unlocked) is again in front.\n11. \u201cMOVE\u201d carries the agent through the door cell (from (3,4) to (3,5)).\n12. Finally, from (3,5) facing RIGHT, the agent executes \u201cPICKUP\u201d to grab the BOX in (3,6).\n\nThis sequence satisfies all constraints and successfully picks up the BOX located in the other room."}
