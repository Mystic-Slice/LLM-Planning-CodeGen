Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nRIGHT\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n    [\"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"LEFT\", \"DROP\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions> \n\nExplanation:\n1. \"MOVE\" \u2013 From the starting cell (3,3) facing RIGHT, move into (3,4).\n2. \"LEFT\" \u2013 Turn to face UP so that the cell above (3,4) is (2,4) where the KEY is located.\n3. \"PICKUP\" \u2013 While at (3,4) facing UP, pick up the KEY from cell (2,4).\n4. \"RIGHT\" \u2013 Turn to face RIGHT so that the door at (3,5) (directly in front) can be unlocked.\n5. \"UNLOCK\" \u2013 While facing RIGHT, unlock the door at (3,5) using the KEY you are holding.\n6. \"LEFT\" \u2013 Turn left (now facing UP) to prepare to drop the KEY into an empty adjacent cell (cell (2,4) is a valid target).\n7. \"DROP\" \u2013 Drop the KEY; you must relinquish it because you cannot pick up the BOX while carrying something.\n8. \"RIGHT\" \u2013 Turn right (now facing RIGHT) to head back toward the door and move into the room with the BOX.\n9. \"MOVE\" \u2013 Move from (3,4) to (3,5) (the unlocked door cell).\n10. \"MOVE\" \u2013 Move to (3,6).\n11. \"MOVE\" \u2013 Move to (3,7).\n12. \"MOVE\" \u2013 Move to (3,8).\n13. \"MOVE\" \u2013 Move to (3,9).\n14. \"RIGHT\" \u2013 Turn right (from facing RIGHT to facing DOWN) so that the cell in front becomes (4,9) where the BOX is located.\n15. \"PICKUP\" \u2013 Finally, pick up the BOX from cell (4,9).\n\nThis sequence satisfies the rules and accomplishes your goal."}
