Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nUP\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n[\"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"LEFT\", \"DROP\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nLet's briefly explain the plan:\n\n1. Starting at (4,3) facing UP, the first MOVE goes to (3,3).  \n2. A LEFT turn changes your direction to LEFT so that a subsequent MOVE from (3,3) takes you to (3,2).  \n3. Facing LEFT at (3,2), the adjacent cell (3,1) holds the KEY so you PICKUP the KEY.  \n4. Now you need to head toward the door (at (4,5) from the door\u2019s adjacent cell) to unlock it. To get there, you reorient: two LEFT turns (from LEFT \u2192 DOWN \u2192 RIGHT) will have you face RIGHT.  \n5. A MOVE from (3,2) facing RIGHT takes you back to (3,3).  \n6. A RIGHT turn then changes your facing from RIGHT to DOWN, and a MOVE brings you to (4,3).  \n7. A LEFT turn from DOWN makes you face RIGHT, and then a MOVE brings you to (4,4) which is immediately left of the DOOR at (4,5).  \n8. With the KEY, you use UNLOCK while facing the DOOR.  \n9. Since you cannot PICKUP the BOX while holding the KEY, you must DROP the KEY. However, you cannot drop it directly in front (which is the DOOR cell) because you can\u2019t drop into a DOOR cell. So you turn LEFT to face UP, where (3,4) is empty, and then drop the KEY there.  \n10. With no object held, you reorient to face RIGHT (the door direction) by turning RIGHT.  \n11. You then MOVE into the door cell and continue moving right through empty cells until you are adjacent to the BOX at (4,9).  \n12. Finally, a PICKUP in front of you collects the BOX.\n\nThis sequence of actions satisfies all the game rules and accomplishes the objective."}
