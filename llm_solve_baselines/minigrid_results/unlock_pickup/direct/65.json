Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nRIGHT\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n[\"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"RIGHT\", \"DROP\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. Starting at (4,1) facing RIGHT, we need the KEY (located at (3,1)) to unlock the door.  \n\u2003\u2022 \"LEFT\" turns the agent to face UP.  \n\u2003\u2022 \"PICKUP\" picks up the KEY from the cell in front (3,1).\n\n2. Now still at (4,1) holding the KEY and facing UP, we head to the cell from which we can unlock the door. The door is at (1,5) (locked) and the agent must approach it from the room side. In this grid the room boundary is the vertical wall at column 5 (except at the door at row1). On the left (room1) a good spot to unlock is (1,4) facing RIGHT. We navigate there:\n\u2003\u2022 \"MOVE\" \u2192 (3,1)  \n\u2003\u2022 \"MOVE\" \u2192 (2,1)  \n\u2003\u2022 \"MOVE\" \u2192 (1,1)\n\n3. At (1,1) facing UP, we need to head east:\n\u2003\u2022 \"RIGHT\" turns the agent to face RIGHT.  \n\u2003\u2022 \"MOVE\" \u2192 (1,2)  \n\u2003\u2022 \"MOVE\" \u2192 (1,3)  \n\u2003\u2022 \"MOVE\" \u2192 (1,4).\n\n4. At (1,4) facing RIGHT, the door is directly ahead at (1,5):\n\u2003\u2022 \"UNLOCK\" uses the KEY (which must be held at unlocking) to unlock the door.\n\n5. Now that the door is unlocked and no longer obstructs passage, we must free our hands in order to pick up the BOX later. (Rules require us not to hold an object when picking up another.) At (1,4) we choose to drop the KEY into an empty adjacent cell. Dropping is allowed only into an adjacent cell that is not a WALL, DOOR, or already occupied. Here, the cell below (2,4) is empty.\n\u2003\u2022 \"RIGHT\" turns from facing RIGHT to facing DOWN.  \n\u2003\u2022 \"DROP\" drops the KEY into (2,4).\n\n6. We now need to go into the second room (room2) where the BOX is located at (2,6). To get there, we return to (1,4) facing RIGHT:\n\u2003\u2022 \"LEFT\" (from facing DOWN, a left turn makes the agent face RIGHT).\n\n7. Now we cross through the door:\n\u2003\u2022 \"MOVE\" \u2192 (1,5) (this cell now is empty because the door was unlocked).  \n\u2003\u2022 \"MOVE\" \u2192 (1,6).\n\n8. The BOX is at (2,6), so from (1,6) the agent should face DOWN:\n\u2003\u2022 \"RIGHT\" turns the agent from facing RIGHT to facing DOWN.\n\n9. Finally, with the BOX directly in front at (2,6):\n\u2003\u2022 \"PICKUP\" picks up the BOX which is the game objective.\n\nThis action list completes the task according to the rules and objectives."}
