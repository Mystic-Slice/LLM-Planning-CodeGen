Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nLEFT\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n[\"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"LEFT\", \"DROP\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. Starting at (2,4) facing LEFT, you want to pick up the KEY at (4,4) from an adjacent cell.  \n   \u2022 Action \"LEFT\": turning left (from LEFT) makes you face DOWN.  \n   \u2022 \"MOVE\": move from (2,4) to (3,4).  \n   \u2022 \"PICKUP\": with you facing DOWN, the cell in front (4,4) contains the KEY, so you pick it up.\n\n2. Now holding the KEY (at (3,4) facing DOWN), you must unlock the door at (4,5). You need to be adjacent to the door with the door cell in front.  \n   \u2022 \"MOVE\": from (3,4) (facing DOWN) move into (4,4).  \n   \u2022 \"LEFT\": turning left from DOWN makes you face RIGHT.  \n   \u2022 \"UNLOCK\": with the KEY in hand, unlock the door located at (4,5).\n\n3. Since you cannot hold two objects and need to pick up the BOX next, you must drop the KEY in an allowable adjacent empty cell (not a door cell).  \n   \u2022 \"LEFT\": from facing RIGHT, turning left makes you face UP.  \n   \u2022 \"DROP\": drop the KEY into the cell in front (which is (3,4) and is empty).\n\n4. Now with empty hands, you need to travel to the right room to pick up the BOX (located at (1,8)).  \n   \u2022 \"RIGHT\": from (4,4) facing UP, turning right sets your orientation to RIGHT.  \n   \u2022 \"MOVE\": move into the door\u2019s cell (4,5).  \n   \u2022 \"MOVE\": from (4,5) facing RIGHT, move to (4,6).\n\n5. Navigate upward toward the BOX\u2019s row:  \n   \u2022 \"LEFT\": from facing RIGHT, turn left to face UP.  \n   \u2022 \"MOVE\": from (4,6) to (3,6).  \n   \u2022 \"MOVE\": from (3,6) to (2,6).  \n   \u2022 \"MOVE\": from (2,6) to (1,6).\n\n6. Finally, position yourself so that the BOX (at (1,8)) is directly in front:  \n   \u2022 \"RIGHT\": from facing UP, turn right to face RIGHT.  \n   \u2022 \"MOVE\": move from (1,6) to (1,7).  \n   \u2022 \"PICKUP\": from (1,7) facing RIGHT, pick up the BOX which is located at (1,8).\n\nThis action sequence meets all the constraints and achieves your objective."}
