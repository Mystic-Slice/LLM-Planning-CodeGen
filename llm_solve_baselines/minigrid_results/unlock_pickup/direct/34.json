Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nUP\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n[\"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"DROP\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the reasoning behind the step\u2010by\u2010step plan:\n\n1. Starting at (2,4) facing UP, the agent turns LEFT to face LEFT.\n2. MOVE: from (2,4) to (2,3).\n3. LEFT: from facing LEFT to face DOWN.\n4. PICKUP: The key is in the cell (3,3) directly in front (down from (2,3)); pick it up.\n5. LEFT: With the key in hand and facing DOWN, a left turn rotates the agent to face RIGHT.\n6. MOVE: Step from (2,3) to (2,4) in the right direction.\n7. LEFT: From facing RIGHT, turn left to face UP.\n8. MOVE: From (2,4) move UP into (1,4). This positions the agent adjacent to the door.\n9. RIGHT: From facing UP, turn right to face RIGHT. Now the DOOR at (1,5) is directly in front.\n10. UNLOCK: With the key in hand, unlock the door at (1,5).\n11. MOVE: Enter the door cell at (1,5).\n12\u201313. To free the hands (since you already hold the key, and you can\u2019t pick up the BOX while holding something), reposition so that an adjacent cell is free for dropping: from facing RIGHT, two LEFT turns change your orientation to face LEFT.\n14. DROP: Drop the key into the empty cell (1,4).\n15\u201316. Now, reorient for the journey into the right room: from facing LEFT, two RIGHT turns make you face RIGHT again.\n17. MOVE: Proceed from (1,5) to (1,6).\n18. RIGHT: Turn to face DOWN.\n19. MOVE: Move down from (1,6) to (2,6).\n20. MOVE: Move further down from (2,6) to (3,6).\n21. PICKUP: With the BOX located at (4,6) directly in front (down from (3,6)), pick up the BOX.\n\nThis sequence guides the agent from the starting room to the key, uses the key to unlock the door, safely drops the key (so the agent\u2019s hands are free), and then moves into the right room to pick up the BOX."}
