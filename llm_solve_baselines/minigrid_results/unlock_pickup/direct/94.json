Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nUP\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n[\"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"RIGHT\", \"DROP\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the explanation of the plan:\n\n1. The agent begins at (1,3) facing UP. To pick up the KEY located at (4,1) (in the same room) without stepping into that cell (since entry into a cell with an object is not allowed), the agent must position itself so that the KEY\u2019s cell is directly in front. The chosen approach is to approach from above \u2013 standing at (3,1) facing DOWN will put (4,1) in front.\n\n2. Actions \u201cLEFT\u201d, then two \u201cMOVE\u201ds bring the agent from (1,3) to (1,1). Then another \u201cLEFT\u201d (turning to face DOWN) and two \u201cMOVE\u201ds bring the agent from (1,1) to (3,1). Now with the KEY directly ahead at (4,1), the agent uses \u201cPICKUP\u201d to grab it.\n\n3. Next, the agent needs to unlock the door at (1,5) (the door between the rooms). The chosen path is to go from (3,1) in room 1 to (1,4), positioning the agent so that facing RIGHT puts the door cell (1,5) directly in front. To do so, the agent turns \u201cLEFT\u201d (from facing DOWN to RIGHT) and uses three \u201cMOVE\u201ds to go from (3,1) \u2192 (3,2) \u2192 (3,3) \u2192 (3,4). Then a \u201cLEFT\u201d turns the agent to face UP and two \u201cMOVE\u201ds bring the agent to (1,4).\n\n4. At (1,4) facing UP, a \u201cRIGHT\u201d turn aligns the agent to face RIGHT into the door cell. The agent then uses \u201cUNLOCK\u201d to open the door (while still holding the KEY).\n\n5. Since the agent cannot pick up another object while holding the KEY, it must drop the KEY first. However, dropping is restricted to an adjacent cell that is empty and not a DOOR. The agent turns \u201cRIGHT\u201d to face DOWN (making sure the cell in front, (2,4), is empty) and uses \u201cDROP\u201d to leave the KEY there.\n\n6. Now free of any held object, the agent reorients by turning \u201cLEFT\u201d (from DOWN to RIGHT) and moves into the door cell at (1,5) with \u201cMOVE\u201d and then further into room 2 at (1,6) with a second \u201cMOVE\u201d.\n\n7. In room 2 the BOX is located at (4,6). The agent needs to approach so that (4,6) is directly ahead. From (1,6) facing RIGHT, a \u201cRIGHT\u201d turn (facing DOWN) followed by two \u201cMOVE\u201ds bring the agent to (3,6). Finally, a \u201cPICKUP\u201d collects the BOX from (4,6).\n\nThis sequence achieves the objective of picking up the BOX in the other room while respecting all movement and object-handling rules."}
