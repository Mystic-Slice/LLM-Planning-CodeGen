Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"WALL\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nDOWN\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n[\"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"DROP\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the explanation of the plan:\n\n1. Starting at (1,4) facing DOWN, we first turn RIGHT so that we face WEST (remember: from DOWN, RIGHT turn points WEST).  \n2. We MOVE from (1,4) to (1,3). Now, facing WEST, the cell immediately ahead is (1,2) which contains the KEY.  \n3. We PICKUP the KEY from (1,2). (Now we are holding the KEY, which we will need to unlock the door.)\n\n4. To head toward the door at (2,5), we need to go down \u2013 so from our current WEST orientation, we turn LEFT which makes us face SOUTH.  \n5. We MOVE from (1,3) to (2,3).  \n6. Now, to progress toward the door, we want to go east. From SOUTH, turning LEFT makes us face EAST.  \n7. We MOVE from (2,3) to (2,4).  \n\n8. Facing EAST at (2,4), the cell ahead (2,5) is the DOOR. We UNLOCK it using our KEY.\n9. We MOVE into the door cell (now at (2,5)), entering the second room.\n10. We MOVE further EAST from (2,5) to (2,6). At this moment we are still holding the KEY.\n\nSince we can hold only one object at a time and the objective is to pick up the BOX, we need to drop the KEY in an empty cell.  \n11. Still at (2,6) and facing EAST, we DROP the KEY into (2,7) (an empty cell).\n\nNow, the BOX is located at (1,6) in the second room.  \n12. From (2,6) (facing EAST), we turn LEFT so as to face NORTH.  \n13. Finally, we PICKUP the BOX from (1,6) (which is directly in front of us).\n\nThis sequence fulfills the objective of retrieving the BOX from the other room."}
