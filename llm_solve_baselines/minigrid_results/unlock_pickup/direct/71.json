Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nLEFT\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n[\"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"LEFT\", \"DROP\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the explanation of the plan:\n\n1. Starting at [1,1] facing LEFT, we want to fetch the KEY at [2,3]. First, we turn LEFT so that from LEFT we face DOWN.\n2. MOVE from [1,1] to [2,1].\n3. Then turn LEFT (from DOWN) so we face RIGHT.\n4. MOVE from [2,1] to [2,2]. Now the cell in front ([2,3]) holds the KEY.\n5. PICKUP picks the KEY (remember you pick up objects from the cell directly ahead).\n6. With the KEY in hand, we must move toward the door at [4,5]. From [2,2] facing RIGHT, we need to head downward. Turning RIGHT (from RIGHT to DOWN) reorients us.\n7\u20138. MOVE twice to go from [2,2] \u2192 [3,2] \u2192 [4,2].\n9. From [4,2] facing DOWN, turn LEFT to face RIGHT.\n10\u201311. MOVE twice along row 4 from [4,2] to [4,3] then to [4,4]. Now the door is immediately to our right at [4,5].\n12. UNLOCK the door using the KEY.\n13\u201314. Since we can hold only one object and we need to pick up the BOX later, we must drop the KEY. We turn LEFT (from RIGHT to UP) so that the cell ahead ([3,4]) is a safe, empty cell, then DROP the KEY there.\n15\u201316. To cross into the right room, turn RIGHT (from UP to RIGHT) and MOVE into the door\u2019s cell at [4,5].\n17. Now, still facing RIGHT in the right room, MOVE to [4,6].\n18. Turn LEFT from RIGHT to face UP.\n19\u201321. MOVE up three times: from [4,6] to [3,6], then to [2,6], and then to [1,6].\n22. Turn RIGHT (from UP to RIGHT) so that the BOX\u2019s cell ([1,8]) lies ahead.\n23. MOVE from [1,6] to [1,7].\n24. Finally, PICKUP the BOX from the cell at [1,8], accomplishing the mission.\n  \nThis sequence of actions safely retrieves the KEY, unlocks the door, drops the KEY to free your hands, navigates to the other room, and picks up the BOX."}
