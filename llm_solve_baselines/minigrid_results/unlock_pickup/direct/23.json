Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nDOWN\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n[\"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"DROP\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. Starting at (4,2) facing DOWN, the key is at (4,4) (to your right). So first turn LEFT to face RIGHT.\n2. MOVE from (4,2) to (4,3).\n3. With the agent now at (4,3) facing RIGHT, the KEY is directly in front (at (4,4)), so use PICKUP to grab it.\n4. Now, to reach the door at (1,5) (in the other room), navigate upward. From (4,3) facing RIGHT, turn LEFT to face UP.\n5.\u20137. MOVE upward three times: from (4,3) to (3,3), then to (2,3), then to (1,3).\n8. At (1,3) facing UP, turn RIGHT so you face RIGHT; then the door at (1,5) lies ahead (with the cell at (1,4) free and door in front from there).\n9. MOVE from (1,3) to (1,4).\n10. With the door now directly ahead and holding the KEY, UNLOCK the door.\n11. MOVE into the door cell: from (1,4) to (1,5). At this point you\u2019re in the second room (the one containing the BOX) but you\u2019re still holding the KEY.\n12. MOVE from (1,5) to (1,6) to get closer to the BOX.\n13. Since you can\u2019t PICKUP the BOX while holding the KEY, reposition to drop the KEY. At (1,6) facing RIGHT, turn RIGHT to face DOWN.\n14. DROP the KEY into the cell in front, which is (2,6) (an empty valid cell).\n15. Now, with empty hands, turn LEFT from facing DOWN so you face RIGHT.\n16. Finally, with (1,7) (the BOX) directly in front, use PICKUP to grab the BOX.\n\nThis sequence meets all the rules of the grid world puzzle."}
