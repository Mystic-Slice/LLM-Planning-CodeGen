Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nUP\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n  [\"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"LEFT\", \"DROP\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions> \n\nExplanation:\n1. Starting at (2,1) facing UP, we first turn RIGHT twice to face DOWN so we can approach the KEY at (4,1). Then we MOVE from (2,1) to (3,1) and use PICKUP (while still at (3,1) facing DOWN) to grab the KEY from (4,1).\n2. Now holding the KEY, we navigate from (3,1) to a cell adjacent to the DOOR at (2,5). We first turn LEFT (from DOWN) to face RIGHT, then MOVE three times: (3,1)\u2192(3,2), (3,2)\u2192(3,3), (3,3)\u2192(3,4). Next, turning LEFT (from RIGHT to UP) and MOVE gives us (2,4), which is immediately to the left of the DOOR.\n3. Facing UP at (2,4), we turn RIGHT to face the DOOR at (2,5) and use UNLOCK (with the KEY in hand) to unlock the door.\n4. Since we cannot pick up the BOX while holding the KEY, we must DROP the KEY into an empty cell. From (2,4) facing RIGHT, we turn LEFT to face UP so that the cell (1,4) is in front (and empty) and then DROP the KEY.\n5. Now, we head through the unlocked door. We turn RIGHT (from UP, now facing RIGHT) and MOVE from (2,4) into the door cell at (2,5).\n6. Finally, to pick up the BOX located at (1,7) in the other room, we MOVE from (2,5) to (2,6) while facing RIGHT, then turn LEFT to face UP and MOVE to (1,6). After that, we turn RIGHT to face the BOX (since (1,7) is directly ahead) and finish by using PICKUP to get the BOX.\n\nThis complete sequence satisfies the objective of retrieving the BOX from the other room."}
