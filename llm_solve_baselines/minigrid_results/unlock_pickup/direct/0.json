Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"KEY\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nUP\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n[\"RIGHT\", \n \"PICKUP\", \n \"MOVE\", \n \"RIGHT\", \n \"MOVE\", \n \"LEFT\", \n \"UNLOCK\", \n \"LEFT\", \n \"LEFT\", \n \"DROP\", \n \"LEFT\", \n \"LEFT\", \n \"MOVE\", \n \"MOVE\", \n \"LEFT\", \n \"MOVE\", \n \"MOVE\", \n \"MOVE\", \n \"RIGHT\", \n \"MOVE\", \n \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. The agent starts at [3,3] facing UP. To pick up the KEY in [3,4] (to east), the agent first turns RIGHT so that it faces east.\n2. With the KEY in the cell in front, the agent uses PICKUP to collect it.\n3. Now holding the KEY, the agent moves east into [3,4].\n4. To head toward the door (which will be unlocked from the south side of the KEY room), the agent turns RIGHT (east \u2192 south) and then moves into [4,4].\n5. The agent now needs to unlock the door located at [4,5] (to the east of [4,4]). Since from facing south a LEFT turn makes the agent face east, the agent turns LEFT.\n6. With the door directly ahead, the UNLOCK action is executed (the KEY must be held to unlock the door).\n7. However, because the agent may only hold one object and the final objective is to pick up the BOX later (located in the other room) the agent must first drop the KEY. To drop the KEY safely, the agent reorients: from east, two LEFT turns (east \u2192 north \u2192 west) point to the west, where cell [4,3] is empty.\n8. The agent uses DROP to leave the KEY behind.\n9. Now needing to cross back through the door, the agent turns from facing west back to east by two LEFT turns (west \u2192 south \u2192 east).\n10. A MOVE then carries the agent from [4,4] into the door cell [4,5], and another MOVE takes the agent further east into [4,6] (inside the BOX room).\n11. To reach the BOX at [1,8] the agent must go north. A LEFT turn (from east) makes the agent face north.\n12. Three consecutive MOVEs take the agent north from [4,6] \u2192 [3,6] \u2192 [2,6] \u2192 [1,6].\n13. Facing north at [1,6], the agent turns RIGHT to face east.\n14. A MOVE positions the agent at [1,7] so that the BOX at [1,8] is directly in front.\n15. Finally, a PICKUP is executed to collect the BOX.\n\nThis sequence satisfies all movement and game rules while achieving the objective."}
