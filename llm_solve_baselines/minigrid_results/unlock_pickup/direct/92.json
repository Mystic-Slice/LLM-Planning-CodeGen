Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nDOWN\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n[\"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"DROP\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. Start at [4,1] facing DOWN. To approach the KEY at [3,2] without entering its cell (since you must remain adjacent to pick it up), first turn left so you face RIGHT.\n2. MOVE from [4,1] to [4,2].\n3. From [4,2] (now facing RIGHT), turn left to face UP. Now the cell immediately in front ([3,2]) contains the KEY.\n4. PICKUP the KEY.\n5. With the KEY in hand and still at [4,2] (since PICKUP works on the adjacent cell), MOVE forward to [3,2].\n6. MOVE forward to [2,2].\n7. Facing UP at [2,2] isn\u2019t ideal to head to the DOOR (which is to the east along row 2). So turn RIGHT to face EAST.\n8. MOVE from [2,2] to [2,3].\n9. MOVE from [2,3] to [2,4]. Now, from [2,4] facing EAST, the cell in front ([2,5]) is the DOOR.\n10. UNLOCK the DOOR (using the KEY).\n11. MOVE into the door cell at [2,5].\n12. MOVE again to [2,6] bringing you deeper into the room containing the BOX.\n13. At [2,6] facing EAST, the BOX is at [2,7] but you can\u2019t pick it up while holding the KEY. So, turn LEFT (from EAST to NORTH).\n14. DROP the KEY into the empty cell [1,6] (which is valid because it\u2019s empty and adjacent).\n15. Turn RIGHT to reorient from NORTH back to EAST.\n16. Finally, with nothing in hand and facing EAST, PICKUP the BOX from [2,7].\n\nThis sequence fulfills the objective under the game rules."}
