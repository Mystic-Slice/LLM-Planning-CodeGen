Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nDOWN\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n    [\"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"LEFT\", \"DROP\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions> \n\nHere's a breakdown of the plan:\n\n1. Starting at (4,4) facing DOWN, turn RIGHT so you face WEST.\n2. MOVE to (4,3) then MOVE to (4,2).\n3. From (4,2) (facing WEST), turn RIGHT to face NORTH.\n4. MOVE to (3,2). Now, the KEY is in the cell immediately ahead (at (2,2)), so use PICKUP to grab the KEY.\n5. Now still at (3,2) facing NORTH (and holding the KEY), MOVE forward to (2,2) to continue your journey.\n6. Turn RIGHT (facing EAST) then MOVE to (2,3) and MOVE to (2,4). Now you\u2019re adjacent to the DOOR at (2,5) (which is directly ahead).\n7. Use UNLOCK (with the KEY in hand) to unlock the door.\n8. Before picking up the BOX later, you must drop the KEY. Turn LEFT to face NORTH; the cell immediately ahead ((1,4)) is empty, so use DROP.\n9. Now turn RIGHT (facing EAST) to face the door again and MOVE into the door cell at (2,5).\n10. MOVE to (2,6). \n11. Turn LEFT (to face NORTH) and MOVE to (1,6).\n12. Turn RIGHT (to face EAST). Now the BOX (located at (1,7)) is directly in front. Use PICKUP to grab the BOX.\n\nThis sequence ensures that you first retrieve the KEY, use it to unlock the door, drop it (so that you can pick up the BOX, since you may only hold one item at a time), and finally get the BOX from the other room."}
