Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nLEFT\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n  [\"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions> \n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. Starting at (4,1) facing LEFT, the agent turns RIGHT to face UP.\n2. MOVE from (4,1) to (3,1).\n3. MOVE from (3,1) to (2,1). Now the agent is one cell to the left of the KEY at (2,2).\n4. TURN RIGHT (from UP to RIGHT) so the KEY is directly ahead.\n5. PICKUP the KEY from (2,2).\n\nNow holding the KEY, the agent must unlock the door at (3,5) to reach the BOX in the other room. The agent plans to approach the door from its left side:\n6. TURN RIGHT from facing RIGHT to face DOWN.\n7. MOVE down from (2,1) to (3,1).\n8. TURN LEFT from DOWN to face RIGHT.\n9-11. MOVE consecutively to go from (3,1) \u2192 (3,2) \u2192 (3,3) \u2192 (3,4). Now the DOOR cell (3,5) is directly ahead.\n12. UNLOCK the door (using the KEY).\n13. MOVE through the door: from (3,4) to (3,5). The door cell is now unlocked and considered empty.\n14-16. MOVE right to progress inside the right room: from (3,5) \u2192 (3,6) \u2192 (3,7) \u2192 (3,8).\n17. TURN LEFT from facing RIGHT to face UP.\n18. MOVE up from (3,8) to (2,8). Now the BOX at (1,8) is directly in front.\n19. PICKUP the BOX.\n\nThis list of actions successfully navigates through the grid, picks up the KEY in the starting (left) room, unlocks the door to transfer to the other (right) room, and finally picks up the BOX."}
