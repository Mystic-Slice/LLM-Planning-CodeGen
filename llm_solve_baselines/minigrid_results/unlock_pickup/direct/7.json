Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nDOWN\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n    [\"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. Starting at (2,1) facing DOWN.\n2. \"MOVE\": Advances to (3,1) (still facing DOWN).\n3. \"LEFT\": Turn left from DOWN to face RIGHT.\n4. \"MOVE\": Advance to (3,2) (facing RIGHT). Now the KEY at (4,2) is directly below.\n5. \"RIGHT\": Turn right from RIGHT to face DOWN.\n6. \"PICKUP\": With the KEY in the cell in front (at (4,2)), pick it up.\n7. With the KEY held and still at (3,2) but facing DOWN, we need to go to the door. In the left room the door at (4,5) is best approached from (4,4) while facing RIGHT.\n8. \"LEFT\": Turn left from DOWN to face RIGHT.\n9. \"MOVE\": From (3,2) move to (3,3) (facing RIGHT).\n10. \"MOVE\": From (3,3) move to (3,4) (facing RIGHT).\n11. \"RIGHT\": Turn right from RIGHT to face DOWN.\n12. \"MOVE\": From (3,4) move down to (4,4) (facing DOWN).\n13. \"LEFT\": Turn left from DOWN to face RIGHT so that, from (4,4), the cell in front is the DOOR at (4,5).\n14. \"UNLOCK\": Unlock the door directly in front (since holding the KEY).\n15. \"MOVE\": Move from (4,4) into the door cell at (4,5).\n16. \"MOVE\": Continue moving from (4,5) to (4,6) (facing RIGHT).\n17. \"PICKUP\": Finally, with the BOX (at (4,7)) directly in front, pick it up.\n\nThis sequence accomplishes the objective of eventually picking up the BOX located in a different room."}
