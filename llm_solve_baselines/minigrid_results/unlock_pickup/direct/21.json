Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nLEFT\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n[\"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"LEFT\", \"DROP\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nExplanation:\n1. Starting at (4,1) facing LEFT, the agent turns RIGHT to face UP.\n2. MOVE advances from (4,1) to (3,1).\n3. TURN RIGHT to face RIGHT.\n4. MOVE from (3,1) to (3,2) so that the KEY (at (3,3)) is immediately ahead.\n5. PICKUP picks up the KEY from the cell (3,3).\n6. LEFT turns from RIGHT to UP.\n7. MOVE from (3,2) to (2,2).\n8. RIGHT turns from UP to face RIGHT.\n9. MOVE from (2,2) to (2,3).\n10. MOVE from (2,3) to (2,4); now the agent is adjacent to the DOOR (at (2,5)).\n11. UNLOCK unlocks the door (while holding the KEY).\n12. LEFT rotates from RIGHT to UP.\n13. DROP leaves the KEY in cell (1,4) (an empty adjacent cell) so that the agent is free to pick up the BOX later.\n14. RIGHT turns from UP to face RIGHT, aligning with the DOOR.\n15. MOVE enters the door cell at (2,5) (now unlocked) from the left room.\n16. MOVE continues from (2,5) to (2,6) into the right room.\n17. RIGHT turns the agent from RIGHT to face DOWN.\n18. MOVE advances from (2,6) to (3,6).\n19. MOVE advances from (3,6) to (4,6).\n20. LEFT turns from DOWN to face RIGHT.\n21. PICKUP picks up the BOX from cell (4,7) (which is directly in front).\n\nThis sequence accomplishes the objective: the agent collects the KEY, unlocks the door, drops the KEY (so as not to be holding an object), passes through to the other room, and finally picks up the BOX."}
