Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nUP\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n[\"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"DROP\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions> \n\nExplanation:\n1. The agent starts at (2,1) facing UP. To head toward the KEY (at [4,3]) in its room, the agent first turns twice (with \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\") to face DOWN, then \u201cMOVE\u201ds down from (2,1) to (3,1) and then to (4,1).  \n2. It then turns \"LEFT\" (from DOWN, a left turn makes it face RIGHT) so that a later \u201cMOVE\u201d from (4,1) to (4,2) puts it adjacent (to the left) of the KEY at (4,3) and then uses \"PICKUP\" to get the KEY.  \n3. Holding the KEY, the agent must unlock the door at (1,5)\u2014the only passage to the room holding the BOX. From (4,2) (facing RIGHT) the agent turns \"LEFT\" (changing to UP) and then \u201cMOVE\u201ds upward three times (to (3,2), (2,2), then (1,2)). It then turns \"RIGHT\" (to face RIGHT) and \u201cMOVE\u201ds twice to reach (1,4), from where the door cell (1,5) is immediately ahead.  \n4. The agent then uses \"UNLOCK\" to open the door while still holding the KEY. To be able to pick up the BOX later (since only one object may be held), the agent must drop the KEY into an empty cell. At (1,4) the agent turns twice (\"LEFT\", \"LEFT\") to face LEFT so that the cell (1,3) is in front and empty, then \"DROP\"s the KEY there.  \n5. The agent then reorients by turning twice more (\"LEFT\", \"LEFT\") so that it faces RIGHT again and \u201cMOVE\u201ds into the door cell at (1,5). From there it \u201cMOVE\u201ds right across (1,6), (1,7), (1,8), and (1,9) to enter the right room.  \n6. At (1,9) facing RIGHT, the BOX is below at (2,9); a \"RIGHT\" turn changes the facing to DOWN and then \"PICKUP\" obtains the BOX.\n\nThis sequence meets the objective of navigating from the starting cell to the KEY, unlocking the door with the KEY, dropping it to free the agent\u2019s hands, and finally picking up the BOX in the other room."}
