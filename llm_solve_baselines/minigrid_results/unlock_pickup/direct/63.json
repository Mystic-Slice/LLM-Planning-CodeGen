Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nDOWN\n</start_direction>\n", "response": "<actions>\n  [\"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nExplanation:\n1. \"RIGHT\" \u2013 Turn from DOWN to face WEST so that the KEY at [1,1] is directly ahead.\n2. \"PICKUP\" \u2013 Pick up the KEY from [1,1].\n3\u20134. \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\" \u2013 From facing WEST, two left turns reorient you to face EAST.\n5\u20136. \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\" \u2013 Move eastward from [1,2] to [1,3] then to [1,4].\n7. \"RIGHT\" \u2013 Turn to face SOUTH.\n8. \"MOVE\" \u2013 Step down to [2,4], positioning yourself to access the DOOR.\n9. \"LEFT\" \u2013 Turn to face EAST so that the DOOR at [2,5] is in front.\n10. \"UNLOCK\" \u2013 Unlock the door at [2,5] using the KEY you hold.\n11. \"MOVE\" \u2013 Enter the door cell at [2,5].\n12. \"MOVE\" \u2013 Continue east into the connected room, arriving at [2,6].\n13. \"LEFT\" \u2013 Turn to face NORTH so the BOX at [1,6] is directly ahead.\n14. \"PICKUP\" \u2013 Pick up the BOX from [1,6].\n"}
