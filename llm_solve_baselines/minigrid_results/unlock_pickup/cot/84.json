Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nUP\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n    [\"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"LEFT\", \"DROP\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nLet's explain our reasoning step by step:\n\n1. We start at (1,1) facing UP in the left room. The KEY is at (2,4) in the left room. To get adjacent to the KEY (so that it appears directly in front when facing RIGHT), we need first to turn so that we can go \u201csouth\u201d then \u201ceast.\u201d  \n   \u2022 Actions 1\u20132 (\u201cRIGHT\u201d, \u201cRIGHT\u201d) turn the agent from UP to DOWN.  \n   \u2022 Action 3 (\u201cMOVE\u201d) moves the agent from (1,1) to (2,1).\n\n2. From (2,1) facing DOWN, by turning left you'll face RIGHT, allowing eastward traverse.  \n   \u2022 Action 4 (\u201cLEFT\u201d) makes the agent face RIGHT.  \n   \u2022 Actions 5 and 6 (\u201cMOVE\u201d, \u201cMOVE\u201d) move the agent from (2,1) through (2,2) to (2,3).\n\n3. Standing at (2,3) and facing RIGHT, the cell in front (2,4) contains the KEY.  \n   \u2022 Action 7 (\u201cPICKUP\u201d) picks up the KEY.\n\n4. Now with the KEY in hand, we need to unlock the door at (3,5) that connects to the right room (where the BOX is). We must get adjacent to the door.  \n   \u2022 Action 8 (\u201cMOVE\u201d) moves the agent from (2,3) to (2,4).  \n   \u2022 Action 9 (\u201cRIGHT\u201d) reorients the agent from facing RIGHT to facing DOWN.  \n   \u2022 Action 10 (\u201cMOVE\u201d) takes the agent from (2,4) to (3,4); now the door cell is immediately to our RIGHT.\n\n5. With the agent at (3,4) facing DOWN, a left turn puts the agent facing RIGHT toward the door.  \n   \u2022 Action 11 (\u201cLEFT\u201d) faces RIGHT.  \n   \u2022 Action 12 (\u201cUNLOCK\u201d) unlocks the door at (3,5), as the KEY is carried.\n\n6. Since you cannot pick up the BOX while still holding the KEY, you must drop it into an empty, non-door cell. Facing right at (3,4) the cell ahead is the door, so you turn away from it.  \n   \u2022 Action 13 (\u201cLEFT\u201d) rotates the agent (from RIGHT) to face UP so that the front cell (2,4) is empty.  \n   \u2022 Action 14 (\u201cDROP\u201d) drops the KEY into (2,4).\n\n7. Now free of any carried object, continue into the right room where the BOX is located.  \n   \u2022 Action 15 (\u201cRIGHT\u201d) from facing UP rotates you to face RIGHT.  \n   \u2022 Action 16 (\u201cMOVE\u201d) takes you from (3,4) into the door cell (3,5).  \n   \u2022 Action 17 (\u201cMOVE\u201d) moves you deeper into the right room at (3,6).\n\n8. The BOX is located at (1,7). From (3,6) you must travel north and then east.  \n   \u2022 Action 18 (\u201cLEFT\u201d) from facing RIGHT rotates you to face UP.  \n   \u2022 Actions 19\u201320 (\u201cMOVE\u201d, \u201cMOVE\u201d) move you from (3,6) to (2,6) and then to (1,6).  \n   \u2022 Action 21 (\u201cRIGHT\u201d) rotates you from UP to RIGHT so that the cell ahead (1,7) contains the BOX.\n\n9. Finally,  \n   \u2022 Action 22 (\u201cPICKUP\u201d) picks up the BOX.\n\nFollowing this plan, you complete your objective: picking up the BOX in the different room."}
