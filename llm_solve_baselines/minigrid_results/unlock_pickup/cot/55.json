Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nUP\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"LEFT\", \"DROP\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nLet's explain step by step:\n\n1. Starting at [2,2] facing UP, the agent turns LEFT to face LEFT.\n2. MOVE brings the agent to [2,1].\n3. Turning LEFT again from facing LEFT makes the agent face DOWN.\n4. With the KEY located at [3,1] (directly in front), the agent issues PICKUP to get the KEY.\n5. Now holding the KEY, the agent turns LEFT from DOWN to face RIGHT.\n6\u20138. The agent moves three times going east: from [2,1] \u2192 [2,2] \u2192 [2,3] \u2192 [2,4].\n9. At [2,4] facing RIGHT, a RIGHT turn makes the agent face DOWN.\n10\u201311. Two MOVE commands take the agent down from [2,4] to [3,4] and then to [4,4].\n12. At [4,4] and facing DOWN, turning LEFT makes the agent face RIGHT\u2014ideal to approach the DOOR at [4,5].\n13. With the DOOR in front and holding the KEY, the agent issues UNLOCK to open the door.\n14\u201315. Now, to free their hand (since one may hold only one object and cannot pick up the BOX when already holding something), the agent turns LEFT to face UP and then DROPs the KEY into the adjacent cell [3,4] (which is empty).\n16. A RIGHT turn from UP resets the agent\u2019s facing to RIGHT again.\n17. MOVE drives the agent into the now-unlocked door cell [4,5] (entering the right room).\n18. Another MOVE takes the agent to [4,6].\n19. Turning LEFT from RIGHT sets the agent facing UP.\n20\u201321. Two MOVE actions carry the agent from [4,6] upward to [3,6] and then to [2,6].\n22. Finally, while at [2,6] facing UP (with the BOX at [1,6] directly ahead), the agent issues PICKUP to acquire the BOX.\n\nThis plan fulfills the objective: picking up the BOX in the other room while following all the rules."}
