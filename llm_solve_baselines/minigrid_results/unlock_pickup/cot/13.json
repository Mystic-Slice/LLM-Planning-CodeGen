Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nDOWN\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n    [\"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"DROP\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the step\u2010by\u2010step reasoning:\n\n1. The agent starts at (4,4) facing DOWN. The key is at (2,2) in the same room.\n2. To head toward the key, the agent first needs to go left. Since facing DOWN, a RIGHT turn faces LEFT \u2192 then MOVE to (4,3).\n3. From (4,3) (facing LEFT), a RIGHT turn makes the agent face UP \u2192 then MOVE to (3,3).\n4. To approach the key, the agent turns LEFT (from UP to LEFT) and MOVEs to (3,2).\n5. Now at (3,2) facing LEFT, a RIGHT turn makes the agent face UP so that the cell in front, (2,2), contains the KEY. The agent executes PICKUP.\n6. Holding the KEY now, the agent needs to unlock the DOOR located at (4,5) (in the wall between rooms). The agent plans a path back:\n   - From (3,2) (facing UP), a RIGHT turn makes the agent face RIGHT and MOVE to (3,3).\n   - A further MOVE from (3,3) to (3,4) (still facing RIGHT).\n   - Then a RIGHT turn (from RIGHT to DOWN) and MOVE from (3,4) to (4,4).\n7. Now at (4,4) facing DOWN, a LEFT turn reorients the agent to face RIGHT so that the DOOR at (4,5) is directly in front. The agent then executes UNLOCK.\n8. With the door unlocked, the agent proceeds into the adjacent room:\n   - MOVE from (4,4) to (4,5), then another MOVE to (4,6), positioning the agent right before the BOX (which is at (4,7)).\n9. However, since the agent is still holding the KEY and cannot hold more than one item, the KEY must be dropped. The agent turns LEFT to face UP so that dropping will occur into an empty cell (cell (3,6)). DROP is executed.\n10. Finally, the agent turns RIGHT (from UP back to RIGHT) so that the BOX is now directly in front, and executes PICKUP to grab the BOX.\n\nThis sequence meets the challenge requirements step by step."}
