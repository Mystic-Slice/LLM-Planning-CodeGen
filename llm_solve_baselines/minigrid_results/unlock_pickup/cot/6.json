Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nLEFT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nLet's explain the plan step by step:\n\n1. Starting at (4,1) facing LEFT, we first need to face the KEY which is at (4,4). Turning \"RIGHT\" twice makes us face RIGHT.\n2. We then \"MOVE\" twice: from (4,1) \u2192 (4,2) and then (4,2) \u2192 (4,3). Now from (4,3) (facing RIGHT) the KEY is directly in front (at (4,4)), so we \"PICKUP\" it.\n3. With the KEY in hand, we must reach the door located at (2,5) to access the room with the BOX. From (4,3) still facing RIGHT, we turn \"LEFT\" so that we face UP.\n4. We \"MOVE\" twice upward: (4,3) \u2192 (3,3) then (3,3) \u2192 (2,3).\n5. Next, we \"RIGHT\" turn to face RIGHT. Moving one step \"MOVE\" takes us from (2,3) \u2192 (2,4). Now the door is directly in front at (2,5), so we \"UNLOCK\" it using our KEY.\n6. After unlocking, we \"MOVE\" into the door cell (from (2,4) to (2,5)) and then \"MOVE\" again to (2,6). \n7. At (2,6) facing RIGHT, we then turn \"RIGHT\" so we face DOWN. Now the BOX is directly in front at (3,6) so we \"PICKUP\" the BOX.\n\nThis sequence of actions meets the objective while following the movement, pickup, and unlocking rules."}
