Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nLEFT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"LEFT\", \"DROP\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Starting at (1,2) facing LEFT, we turn LEFT so that we face DOWN.\n2. MOVE from (1,2) to (2,2).\n3. MOVE from (2,2) to (3,2).\n4. From (3,2) facing DOWN, turning LEFT makes us face RIGHT.\n5. MOVE from (3,2) to (3,3).\n6. From (3,3) facing RIGHT, turning RIGHT makes us face DOWN.\n7. With the KEY at (4,3) directly in front (cell (4,3) when facing DOWN), we PICKUP the KEY.\n8\u20139. We now need to head toward the door. From (3,3) facing DOWN, two RIGHT turns (step 8 and 9) make us face UP.\n10. MOVE up from (3,3) to (2,3).\n11. A RIGHT turn from UP makes us face RIGHT.\n12. MOVE from (2,3) to (2,4) so that we stand adjacent (to the LEFT) of the door.\n13. With the door at (2,5) directly in front, we UNLOCK it using our KEY.\n14. Now, since we cannot pick up the BOX while holding the KEY, from (2,4) facing RIGHT, a LEFT turn makes us face UP.\n15. DROP the KEY into (1,4), which is empty.\n16. Turn RIGHT (from UP to RIGHT) to align with the door.\n17. MOVE into the door cell at (2,5).\n18. MOVE from (2,5) to (2,6) in the right room.\n19. A RIGHT turn from RIGHT makes us face DOWN.\n20. Finally, with the BOX at (3,6) directly in front, we PICKUP the BOX.\n\nThis sequence successfully collects the BOX from the other room."}
