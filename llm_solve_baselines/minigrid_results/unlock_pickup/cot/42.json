Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nDOWN\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"DROP\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nLet's explain the plan step\u2010by\u2010step:\n\n1. Starting at (3,2) facing DOWN, we turn LEFT so that we now face EAST.\n2. We MOVE forward from (3,2) to (3,3).\n3. With the KEY in the cell (3,4) directly ahead, we PICKUP the KEY.\n4. Now holding the KEY (needed to unlock the door), we change direction. From EAST, we turn LEFT to face NORTH.\n5\u20136. We MOVE twice going NORTH from (3,3) to (2,3) then to (1,3).\n7. At (1,3) facing NORTH, we turn RIGHT so that we face EAST. Our target door cell is one step ahead from our position at (1,4) (since door is at (1,5)).\n8. We MOVE eastward to (1,4).\n9. Facing EAST with the door in front at (1,5), we use UNLOCK (with the KEY in hand) to open the door.\n10. We MOVE into the door cell at (1,5)\u2014entering the right-side room.\n11\u201312. We now need to get rid of our KEY because we cannot pick up the BOX while holding another object. At (1,5) facing EAST, we turn LEFT twice to face WEST.\n13. With (1,4) directly in front (an empty cell), we DROP the KEY.\n14\u201315. We then reorient ourselves back to facing EAST (by turning RIGHT twice).\n16\u201319. Now in the right room, we MOVE east from (1,5) through (1,6), (1,7), (1,8) and arrive at (1,9).\n20. We turn RIGHT to face SOUTH.\n21\u201322. We MOVE SOUTH from (1,9) to (2,9) and then to (3,9).\n23. Finally, while at (3,9) facing SOUTH, the BOX is in the adjacent cell (4,9), so we PICKUP the BOX.\n\nThis sequence satisfies the rules and accomplishes the objective."}
