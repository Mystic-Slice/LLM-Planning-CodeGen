Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nLEFT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n  [\"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"DROP\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions> \n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n1. Starting at [2,4] facing LEFT, the agent first turns left to face DOWN.\n2. It moves from [2,4] to [3,4]. Now the cell in front ([4,4]) holds the KEY.\n3. With a PICKUP action, the agent picks up the KEY (from the cell at [4,4] in front).\n4. Moving forward (still facing DOWN), the agent enters [4,4].\n5. Turning LEFT while facing DOWN makes the agent face RIGHT.\n6. With the KEY in hand, the agent uses UNLOCK to unlock the door directly in front (cell [4,5]).\n7. The agent then moves into the door cell ([4,5]). At this point it is still holding the KEY.\n8\u20139. Since the rules forbid holding two objects, before picking the BOX the agent must drop the KEY. The agent turns RIGHT twice (from facing RIGHT \u2192 DOWN \u2192 LEFT) so that the cell in front becomes [4,4] (an empty cell off its intended path).\n10. The agent DROPs the KEY into [4,4].\n11\u201312. To resume navigating toward the BOX, the agent turns RIGHT twice (from facing LEFT: RIGHT turn \u2192 UP, and another RIGHT turn \u2192 RIGHT) so that it is now facing RIGHT.\n13\u201314. Moving twice, the agent advances from [4,5] to [4,6] and then to [4,7].\n15. A LEFT turn from RIGHT makes it face UP.\n16\u201318. With three MOVE actions the agent goes upward: from [4,7] to [3,7], then to [2,7], and finally to [1,7].\n19. A RIGHT turn while facing UP reorients the agent to face RIGHT.\n20. Finally, with the BOX located in the cell in front ([1,8]), a PICKUP action collects the BOX.\n\nThis complete sequence satisfies the objective of picking up the BOX located in the other room."}
