Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nUP\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nLet\u2019s explain the plan step by step:\n\n1. Starting at (4,3) facing UP, we want to get the KEY at (2,1) without stepping into the KEY\u2019s cell. We first move UP twice:\n\u2003\u2022 \"MOVE\" to (3,3)\n\u2003\u2022 \"MOVE\" to (2,3)\n2. Then we turn LEFT (from UP to LEFT) and \u201cMOVE\u201d to (2,2). Now the KEY is directly in front (at (2,1)):\n\u2003\u2022 \"LEFT\"\n\u2003\u2022 \"MOVE\"\n\u2003\u2022 \"PICKUP\" to grab the KEY.\n3. With the KEY in hand, we head toward the door at (3,5). We reposition from (2,2) (facing LEFT) by turning so we can go down:\n\u2003\u2022 \"LEFT\" (now facing DOWN)\n\u2003\u2022 \"MOVE\" to (3,2)\n4. From (3,2) we need to head right toward (3,4), the cell just to the left of the door. Turning from DOWN to RIGHT is achieved by:\n\u2003\u2022 \"LEFT\" (from DOWN, turning left faces RIGHT)\n\u2003\u2022 \"MOVE\" to (3,3)\n\u2003\u2022 \"MOVE\" to (3,4)\n5. Now, with the door directly ahead (at (3,5)), we use:\n\u2003\u2022 \"UNLOCK\" (using our KEY)\n\u2003\u2022 \"MOVE\" to step through the now unlocked door into the right room.\n6. In the right room, the BOX is at (4,9). From (3,5) facing RIGHT, we navigate:\n\u2003\u2022 \"MOVE\" to (3,6)\n\u2003\u2022 \"MOVE\" to (3,7)\n\u2003\u2022 \"MOVE\" to (3,8)\n7. At (3,8) still facing RIGHT, we turn to head down:\n\u2003\u2022 \"RIGHT\" to face DOWN\n\u2003\u2022 \"MOVE\" to (4,8)\n8. Finally, at (4,8) we turn so that the BOX at (4,9) is directly in front:\n\u2003\u2022 \"LEFT\" (turning from DOWN to RIGHT)\n\u2003\u2022 \"PICKUP\" to collect the BOX.\n\nThis sequence completes the objective."}
