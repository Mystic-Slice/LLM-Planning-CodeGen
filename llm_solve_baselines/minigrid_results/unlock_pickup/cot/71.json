Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nLEFT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n    [\"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"DROP\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the step\u2010by\u2010step reasoning:\n\n1. Starting at (1,1) facing LEFT, we first need to face RIGHT to head toward the KEY (located at (2,3)). Since turning RIGHT twice from LEFT (i.e. LEFT \u2192 UP then UP \u2192 RIGHT), we do \u201cRIGHT\u201d, \u201cRIGHT\u201d.\n2. We then MOVE twice to go from (1,1) to (1,2) and then to (1,3).\n3. Now, to pick up the KEY in the cell (2,3) (which is directly below (1,3)), we must face DOWN. So we turn RIGHT (from RIGHT to DOWN) and then execute a PICKUP.\n4. Holding the KEY, we can\u2019t enter a cell with an object; we need to remain safely in an adjacent cell. So, we MOVE from (1,3) to (2,3), then again to (3,3).\n5. To approach the door transition area, we need to navigate to the cell (4,4) (which is adjacent to the door at (4,5)). At (3,3) (facing DOWN), we turn LEFT to face RIGHT and MOVE into (3,4).\n6. Next, turning RIGHT (from RIGHT to DOWN) aligns us to MOVE from (3,4) down to (4,4).\n7. At (4,4) with the KEY, we turn LEFT (from DOWN to RIGHT) to face the door at (4,5) and then UNLOCK it using the KEY.\n8. We then MOVE into the door cell at (4,5) and further MOVE into (4,6) in the right room.\n9. Since we cannot pick up the BOX while holding another object, we DROP the KEY into the adjacent empty cell (with a DROP performed while facing RIGHT, depositing it into (4,7)).\n10. Now, from (4,6) facing RIGHT, we turn LEFT (to face UP) and MOVE upward through (3,6), (2,6), and then (1,6).\n11. At (1,6) (facing UP), a RIGHT turn points us toward the BOX located at (1,8). We MOVE to (1,7) and then execute PICKUP to grab the BOX.\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal of fetching the BOX from the other room."}
