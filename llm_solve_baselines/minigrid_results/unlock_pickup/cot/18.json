Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nLEFT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n  [\"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the step\u2010by\u2010step breakdown:\n\n1. Starting at (3,3) facing LEFT (west), the agent moves forward to (3,2) with \"MOVE\".\n2. From (3,2) facing west, \"RIGHT\" turns the agent to face NORTH.\n3. \"MOVE\" advances the agent from (3,2) to (2,2).\n4. \"LEFT\" from NORTH rotates the agent to face WEST. Now the cell in front is (2,1) where the KEY is located.\n5. \"PICKUP\" picks up the KEY (the object in (2,1) without entering that cell).\n6. Now holding the KEY and at (2,2) facing WEST, \"LEFT\" turns the agent to face SOUTH.\n7. \"MOVE\" brings the agent down to (3,2).\n8. \"LEFT\" from SOUTH changes the facing to EAST.\n9. \"MOVE\" moves the agent from (3,2) to (3,3).\n10. \"MOVE\" moves the agent further east to (3,4).\n11. \"RIGHT\" rotates from EAST to face SOUTH.\n12. \"MOVE\" carries the agent from (3,4) to (4,4). This positions the agent just west of the door.\n13. To face the door at (4,5), which lies east of (4,4), \"LEFT\" turns the agent from SOUTH to EAST.\n14. \"UNLOCK\" is used to unlock the door directly in front (at (4,5)) since the agent is holding the KEY.\n15. With the door unlocked, \"MOVE\" moves the agent into the door cell at (4,5).\n16. Finally, \"PICKUP\" picks up the BOX, which is directly in front (at (4,6)).\n\nThis sequence enables the agent to retrieve the BOX from the other room."}
