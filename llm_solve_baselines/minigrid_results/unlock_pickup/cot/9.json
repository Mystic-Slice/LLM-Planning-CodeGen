Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nUP\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n  [\"LEFT\", \n   \"MOVE\", \n   \"LEFT\", \n   \"MOVE\", \n   \"MOVE\", \n   \"RIGHT\", \n   \"MOVE\", \n   \"LEFT\", \n   \"PICKUP\", \n   \"LEFT\", \n   \"LEFT\", \n   \"MOVE\", \n   \"RIGHT\", \n   \"MOVE\", \n   \"MOVE\", \n   \"UNLOCK\", \n   \"MOVE\", \n   \"MOVE\", \n   \"MOVE\", \n   \"MOVE\", \n   \"MOVE\", \n   \"RIGHT\", \n   \"MOVE\", \n   \"RIGHT\", \n   \"DROP\", \n   \"LEFT\", \n   \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\n----------------------------------------------------\nStep\u2010by\u2010step explanation:\n\n1. The agent starts at row1, col4 facing UP.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 \"LEFT\" turns the agent to face LEFT.  \n2. \"MOVE\" brings the agent to (1,3).  \n3. \"LEFT\" makes the agent face DOWN.  \n4\u20135. Two \"MOVE\" actions let the agent go from (1,3) to (2,3) then to (3,3).  \n6. \"RIGHT\" turns the agent to face LEFT.  \n7. \"MOVE\" brings the agent to (3,2).  \n8. \"LEFT\" adjusts the orientation to face DOWN so that the cell ahead, (4,2), contains the KEY.  \n9. \"PICKUP\" picks up the KEY.  \n\n10\u201311. With the KEY held and facing DOWN, two \"LEFT\" actions reorient the agent to face UP.  \n12. \"MOVE\" goes from (3,2) to (2,2).  \n13. \"RIGHT\" turns the agent to face RIGHT.  \n14\u201315. Two \"MOVE\" actions move the agent from (2,2) to (2,3) then to (2,4), adjacent to the door cell at (2,5).  \n16. \"UNLOCK\" uses the KEY to unlock the door in front at (2,5).  \n17. \"MOVE\" steps into the door cell at (2,5).  \n\n18\u201321. Four \"MOVE\" actions take the agent through cells (2,6) \u2192 (2,7) \u2192 (2,8) \u2192 (2,9) in the adjacent room.  \n22. \"RIGHT\" rotates the agent from facing RIGHT to face DOWN.  \n23. \"MOVE\" steps down from (2,9) to (3,9).  \n\nNow at (3,9), the agent is still holding the KEY but needs to pick up the BOX (and cannot hold two objects).  \n\u2003\u2003To free up its hands, the agent must drop the KEY into an empty cell.  \n24. \"RIGHT\" turns the agent from DOWN to face LEFT so that it can drop the KEY into cell (3,8), which is empty.  \n25. \"DROP\" leaves the KEY behind.  \n\nFinally, to pick up the BOX located at (4,9):  \n26. \"LEFT\" reorients the agent from facing LEFT to face DOWN.  \n27. \"PICKUP\" picks up the BOX from the cell directly in front (4,9).\n\nThis sequence successfully navigates from the starting room, picks up the KEY to unlock the door, moves into the other room, and finally picks up the BOX as required."}
