Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nUP\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n    [\"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"DROP\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Starting at (4,1) facing UP, the KEY is at (3,4). To reach a position where the KEY is directly in front, we first move UP from (4,1) to reach (3,1).\n\n2. At (3,1) still facing UP, we turn RIGHT so that moving will take us eastward.\n\n3. Moving from (3,1) facing RIGHT, we step into (3,2), and then a second MOVE brings us to (3,3). Now the KEY at (3,4) is directly ahead.\n\n4. Using PICKUP at (3,3) facing RIGHT, we pick up the KEY (which is in (3,4)).\n\n5. Holding the KEY, we now approach the DOOR which is at (3,5). A MOVE from (3,3) to (3,4) (still facing RIGHT) brings us adjacent to the door.\n\n6. With the DOOR now directly in front at (3,5), we use the UNLOCK action to unlock it.\n\n7. We then MOVE from (3,4) through the door (now unlocked) into cell (3,5).\n\n8. Since we cannot pick up the BOX while holding the KEY, we DROP the KEY. Facing RIGHT at (3,5), the cell directly ahead (3,6) is empty so DROP is allowed.\n\n9. Next, we MOVE from (3,5) to (3,6).\n\n10. At (3,6) we need to pick up the BOX located at (2,6). Turning LEFT from facing RIGHT makes us face UP.\n\n11. Finally, with (2,6) directly in front, we perform PICKUP to collect the BOX.\n\nThis sequence satisfies the rules and reaches the objective of picking up the BOX in the other room."}
