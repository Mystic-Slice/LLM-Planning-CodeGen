Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nDOWN\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"LEFT\", \"DROP\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nLet's explain step\u2010by\u2010step our plan:\n\n1. Starting at [3,2] facing DOWN, we need to get the KEY at [4,3].  \n   \u2022 \"MOVE\": Go down from [3,2] to [4,2].  \n   \u2022 \"LEFT\": Turn left (from DOWN to EAST) so that KEY at [4,3] is in front.  \n   \u2022 \"MOVE\": Advance from [4,2] to [4,3].  \n   \u2022 \"PICKUP\": Pick up the KEY.\n\n2. Next, head toward the DOOR at [4,5] to unlock it (the door separates the rooms).  \n   \u2022 \"MOVE\": With the agent now at [4,3] facing EAST, move to [4,4].  \n   \u2022 \"UNLOCK\": With the door in front at [4,5], unlock it using the KEY.\n\n3. Since we cannot pick up the BOX while holding an object and the KEY is no longer needed, drop the KEY in an empty adjacent cell.  \n   \u2022 \"LEFT\": Turn left (from EAST to NORTH) so that [3,4] is in front \u2013 a valid empty cell.  \n   \u2022 \"DROP\": Drop the KEY at [3,4].\n\n4. Now, head into the right room (formerly locked by the DOOR) to reach the BOX at [1,9].  \n   \u2022 \"RIGHT\": Turn right (from NORTH to EAST) to face the unlocked door.  \n   \u2022 \"MOVE\": Step into the door cell at [4,5].  \n   \u2022 \"MOVE\": Move further east to [4,6] in the right room.\n\n5. The BOX is located in the northern area of the right room, so proceed north.  \n   \u2022 \"LEFT\": Turn left (from EAST to NORTH).  \n   \u2022 \"MOVE\": Go from [4,6] to [3,6].  \n   \u2022 \"MOVE\": Continue north from [3,6] to [2,6].  \n   \u2022 \"MOVE\": Keep moving north from [2,6] to [1,6].\n\n6. Now, reorient east to approach the BOX.  \n   \u2022 \"RIGHT\": Turn right (from NORTH to EAST).\n\n7. Finally, move east until you are adjacent to the BOX.  \n   \u2022 \"MOVE\": Go from [1,6] to [1,7].  \n   \u2022 \"MOVE\": Move from [1,7] to [1,8].  \n   \u2022 \"PICKUP\": With [1,9] (where the BOX is) directly in front, pick up the BOX.\n\nThis complete action sequence satisfies all the rules of the environment and accomplishes the objective of retrieving the BOX located in the other room."}
