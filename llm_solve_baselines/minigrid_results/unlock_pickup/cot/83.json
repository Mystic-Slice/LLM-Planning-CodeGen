Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nRIGHT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"LEFT\", \"DROP\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nLet's explain our reasoning step by step:\n\n1. Starting at row2,col2 facing RIGHT, we need to pick up the KEY at row2,col1 (to our left). Two LEFT turns will orient us to face LEFT, so the cell directly ahead is (2,1), where the KEY is. Then a PICKUP picks it up.\n2. Now holding the KEY (which is needed to unlock the door later), we need to reach the door at row3,col5. From (2,2) facing LEFT, a LEFT turn (from LEFT to DOWN) reorients us to face DOWN.\n3. A MOVE brings us from row2,col2 to row3,col2.\n4. At row3,col2 facing DOWN, a LEFT turn makes us face RIGHT. Two MOVEs then bring us from (3,2) to (3,3) and then to (3,4). At (3,4) facing RIGHT the door is directly in front (at row3,col5).\n5. With the KEY in hand, an UNLOCK action unlocks the door.\n6. Before picking up the BOX, we must drop the KEY because we cannot hold two objects. Dropping the KEY into the cell directly in front is not allowed since (3,5) (the door cell) is on our way to the BOX. Instead, we turn LEFT at (3,4) to face UP so that the cell (2,4) is empty; a DROP places the KEY there.\n7. We then reorient by turning RIGHT (from UP to RIGHT) so that continuing from (3,4) facing RIGHT, a MOVE takes us through the unlocked door (cell (3,5)) and places us in position to pick up the BOX, which is located in (3,6) directly ahead.\n8. Finally, a PICKUP acquires the BOX.\n\nThis sequence of actions meets the objective and obeys all game rules."}
