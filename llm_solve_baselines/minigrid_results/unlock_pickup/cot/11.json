Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nLEFT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n  [\"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"RIGHT\", \"DROP\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nLet\u2019s explain the plan step by step:\n\n1. Starting at (2,3) facing LEFT, first turn to face DOWN so you can approach the KEY at (4,3). (Action: \"LEFT\")\n2. Now at (2,3) facing DOWN, \"MOVE\" to go to (3,3). (Action: \"MOVE\")\n3. With KEY located in the cell in front of you ((4,3)), \"PICKUP\" it. (Action: \"PICKUP\")\n   \n   (At this point you\u2019re at (3,3) holding the KEY.)\n\n4. You must now unlock the door at (1,5) (door cell is accessible from the other room). From (3,3) facing DOWN, you need to turn to face UP. Two \"LEFT\" actions will do this. (Actions: \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\")\n5. \"MOVE\" from (3,3) to (2,3) facing UP. (Action: \"MOVE\")\n6. \"MOVE\" from (2,3) to (1,3) facing UP. (Action: \"MOVE\")\n7. Now at (1,3) and facing UP, turn \"RIGHT\" to face EAST so that the cell directly in front ((1,4)) will help you approach the door. (Action: \"RIGHT\")\n8. \"MOVE\" from (1,3) to (1,4) facing EAST. (Action: \"MOVE\")\n9. With the door at (1,5) now in front of you, \"UNLOCK\" it using the KEY. (Action: \"UNLOCK\")\n   \n   (The door cell becomes unlocked\u2014and thus empty\u2014but you are still holding the KEY.)\n\n10. Since you cannot pick up the BOX while holding the KEY, reorient at (1,4) to drop the KEY into a valid empty cell. Turn \"RIGHT\" from EAST so you face DOWN (where (2,4) is empty). (Action: \"RIGHT\")\n11. \"DROP\" the KEY into (2,4). (Action: \"DROP\")\n    \n    (Now you are empty-handed.)\n\n12. Next, head through the unlocked door. From (1,4) facing DOWN, turn \"LEFT\" so that you face EAST again, which is the direction toward the door cell at (1,5). (Action: \"LEFT\")\n13. \"MOVE\" from (1,4) into the door cell (1,5) facing EAST. (Action: \"MOVE\")\n14. Now, continue moving along the room\u2019s corridor: \"MOVE\" right into (1,6). (Action: \"MOVE\")\n15. \"MOVE\" right into (1,7). (Action: \"MOVE\")\n16. \"MOVE\" right into (1,8). (Action: \"MOVE\")\n17. \"MOVE\" right into (1,9). (Action: \"MOVE\")\n18. At (1,9) facing EAST, turn \"RIGHT\" so you face DOWN (and thus can see the BOX at (2,9) immediately in front). (Action: \"RIGHT\")\n19. Finally, \"PICKUP\" the BOX located in (2,9). (Action: \"PICKUP\")\n\nThis sequence of actions moves you from your starting cell, collects the KEY needed to unlock the door, drops the KEY so you can later pick up the BOX, travels through the door to the BOX\u2019s room, and finally picks up the BOX."}
