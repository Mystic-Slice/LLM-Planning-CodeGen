Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nUP\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"DROP\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nLet's explain step by step:\n\n1. Starting at (1,2) facing UP, we first turn LEFT to face WEST.\n2. MOVE from (1,2) to (1,1).\n3. Turn LEFT again (facing WEST \u2192 turn left \u2192 now facing DOWN) so that the cell in front becomes (2,1) where the KEY is.\n4. PICKUP the KEY from (2,1).\n5. With the KEY in hand, we need to go unlock the DOOR to enter the room with the BOX. From (1,1) and facing DOWN, we turn LEFT to face EAST.\n6\u20138. MOVE three times along row 1: from (1,1) \u2192 (1,2), then (1,2) \u2192 (1,3), and then (1,3) \u2192 (1,4). Now we're immediately left of the DOOR.\n9. With the DOOR at (1,5) directly in front (and holding the KEY), we UNLOCK it.\n10. MOVE into the door cell (1,5).\n11\u201313. MOVE three more times to continue east: (1,5) \u2192 (1,6), then (1,6) \u2192 (1,7), and finally (1,7) \u2192 (1,8). Now we are in the second room.\n14. At (1,8) facing EAST with the KEY, we need to drop the KEY before picking up the BOX (since you can only hold one object). Turn RIGHT so that you face DOWN; the cell (2,8) is empty.\n15. DROP the KEY into (2,8).\n16. Turn LEFT (from facing DOWN to facing EAST) so that you face the BOX at (1,9).\n17. Finally, PICKUP the BOX from (1,9).\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal step-by-step."}
