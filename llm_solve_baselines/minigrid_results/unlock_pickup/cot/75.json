Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nUP\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"DROP\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the step\u2010by\u2010step explanation:\n\n1. Starting at [1,2] facing UP, the agent first needs to head toward the KEY at [4,4].  \n   \u2022 \"RIGHT\": Turn from UP to face RIGHT.  \n   \u2022 \"MOVE\": Step from [1,2] to [1,3].  \n   \u2022 \"MOVE\": Step from [1,3] to [1,4].\n\n2. Now the agent needs to move downward to reach a position adjacent to the KEY.  \n   \u2022 \"RIGHT\": Turn from RIGHT to face DOWN.  \n   \u2022 \"MOVE\": Move from [1,4] to [2,4].  \n   \u2022 \"MOVE\": Move from [2,4] to [3,4].  \n   \n   At [3,4] facing DOWN, the cell directly in front ([4,4]) contains the KEY.\n\n3. Pick up the KEY.  \n   \u2022 \"PICKUP\": Pick up the KEY from [4,4].\n\n4. To unlock the door (located in cell [3,5]), the agent must face it. From [3,4], adjust orientation:  \n   \u2022 \"LEFT\": From facing DOWN, turning left makes the agent face RIGHT (since left from South is East).  \n   \u2022 \"UNLOCK\": With the KEY held, unlock the door in [3,5].\n\n5. The agent now must drop the KEY before picking up the BOX (since only one object can be held). The KEY must be dropped in an empty cell that isn\u2019t a door or wall. Choosing the left cell ([3,3]) works.  \n   Since the agent is at [3,4] facing RIGHT, first reorient to face LEFT:  \n   \u2022 \"LEFT\": Turn left from RIGHT \u2192 now facing UP.  \n   \u2022 \"LEFT\": Turn left from UP \u2192 now facing LEFT.  \n   \u2022 \"DROP\": Drop the KEY into [3,3].\n\n6. Next, the agent must reorient to reach the door and cross into the room with the BOX. Currently facing LEFT, the door is to the right:  \n   \u2022 \"LEFT\": Turn left from LEFT \u2192 now facing SOUTH.  \n   \u2022 \"LEFT\": Turn left from SOUTH \u2192 now facing RIGHT.\n\n7. Move through the door into the second room.  \n   \u2022 \"MOVE\": From [3,4] move right into [3,5] (the door cell, now unlocked).  \n   \u2022 \"MOVE\": Continue from [3,5] to [3,6].  \n   \u2022 \"MOVE\": Continue from [3,6] to [3,7].\n\n8. At [3,7], the BOX is located in the cell directly below ([4,7]). Adjust orientation to face downwards:  \n   \u2022 \"RIGHT\": Turn right from facing RIGHT to face DOWN.  \n\n9. Finally, pick up the BOX.  \n   \u2022 \"PICKUP\": Pick up the BOX located at [4,7].\n\nThis sequence of actions successfully navigates the grid, obtains the KEY (to unlock the door), unlocks it, drops the KEY to free the hand, crosses into the other room, and eventually picks up the BOX."}
