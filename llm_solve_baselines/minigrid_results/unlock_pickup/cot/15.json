Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nDOWN\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"DROP\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nLet's explain step\u2010by\u2010step:\n\n1. Starting at (2,4) facing DOWN, we first need to get the KEY at (1,2) which is in the left room. To reach it we:\n   - Turn so you face WEST (from DOWN a RIGHT turn yields WEST).\n   - Move twice from (2,4) to (2,3) then to (2,2).\n   - Then turn RIGHT (from WEST, a RIGHT turn faces NORTH) so that the cell in front, (1,2), has the KEY.\n   - Execute PICKUP to get the KEY.\n\n2. With the KEY in hand, navigate from (2,2) to the door cell. The door is at (4,5), and the proper unlocking position is from the left side at (4,4) facing EAST.\n   - From (2,2) facing NORTH, turn RIGHT to face EAST.\n   - Move twice to go from (2,2) \u2192 (2,3) \u2192 (2,4).\n   - Then turn RIGHT (from EAST, a RIGHT turn faces SOUTH) and move twice to go from (2,4) \u2192 (3,4) \u2192 (4,4).\n\n3. At (4,4) facing SOUTH, turn LEFT to face EAST and use UNLOCK to open the door at (4,5).\n\n4. After unlocking, step into the door and enter the right room:\n   - MOVE from (4,4) \u2192 (4,5) (through the door cell),\n   - Then MOVE from (4,5) \u2192 (4,6) (now in the room with the BOX).\n\n5. You now face EAST at (4,6) while still holding the KEY. But you cannot pick up the BOX while holding an object. So, you need to drop the KEY first\u2014choosing an empty cell that is not a DOOR. To do this:\n   - Turn LEFT (from EAST, LEFT gives NORTH) so that the cell ahead (3,6) is empty.\n   - DROP the KEY into (3,6).\n\n6. With empty hands, reorient (turn RIGHT from NORTH to face EAST) and proceed toward the BOX at (4,9):\n   - MOVE from (4,6) \u2192 (4,7),\n   - MOVE from (4,7) \u2192 (4,8).\n   \n7. Finally, with the BOX immediately in front at (4,9), execute PICKUP to grab the BOX.\n\nThis sequence meets all constraints and reaches the objective."}
