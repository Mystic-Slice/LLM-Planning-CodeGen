Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nDOWN\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n  [\"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"DROP\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nBelow is the step\u2010by\u2010step reasoning:\n\n1. \u2022 Starting at (1,4) facing DOWN, the KEY is at (4,4) in the same (left) room.  \n   \u2013 Action 1: MOVE \u2192 advances from (1,4) to (2,4).  \n   \u2013 Action 2: MOVE \u2192 advances from (2,4) to (3,4).  \n   \u2013 Action 3: PICKUP \u2192 while facing DOWN, picks up the KEY in cell (4,4).\n\n2. \u2022 With the KEY in hand at (3,4) facing DOWN, head back to the door (located at (2,5) on the room boundary) so that you can unlock it.  \n   \u2013 Action 4: RIGHT \u2192 from DOWN, turning RIGHT changes your facing to LEFT.  \n   \u2013 Action 5: RIGHT \u2192 another RIGHT turn moves your facing from LEFT to UP.  \n   \u2013 Action 6: MOVE \u2192 moving UP from (3,4) brings you to (2,4).  \n   \u2013 Action 7: RIGHT \u2192 now facing from UP to RIGHT.  \n   \u2013 Action 8: UNLOCK \u2192 while facing RIGHT, you unlock the door at (2,5).\n\n3. \u2022 Since you can carry only one object at a time and your objective is to eventually PICKUP the BOX in the other room, you must drop the KEY. Choose an adjacent cell that is empty and does not block your planned path.  \n   \u2013 At (2,4) facing RIGHT (after unlocking) you now reorient so that the drop cell is not on your future route.  \n   \u2013 Action 9: RIGHT \u2192 turning from RIGHT to DOWN.  \n   \u2013 Action 10: RIGHT \u2192 turning from DOWN to LEFT.  \n   \u2013 Action 11: DROP \u2192 with the cell immediately in front ((2,3)) empty, you drop the KEY.\n\n4. \u2022 Now free of the KEY, you need to reorient to enter the right room via the unlocked door.  \n   \u2013 Action 12: LEFT \u2192 from facing LEFT, a LEFT turn rotates you to face SOUTH.  \n   \u2013 Action 13: LEFT \u2192 another LEFT turn brings you to face EAST (i.e. RIGHT).  \n   \u2013 Action 14: MOVE \u2192 moving from (2,4) to (2,5) takes you through the unlocked door into the right room.\n\n5. \u2022 In the right room your target BOX is located at (4,9). To pick it up the BOX must be in the cell directly in front of you. A good plan is to approach it from (4,8) while facing RIGHT.  \n   \u2013 Action 15: MOVE \u2192 from (2,5) to (2,6).  \n   \u2013 Action 16: MOVE \u2192 from (2,6) to (2,7).  \n   \u2013 Action 17: MOVE \u2192 from (2,7) to (2,8).  \n   \u2013 Action 18: RIGHT \u2192 turning from facing RIGHT to face DOWN.  \n   \u2013 Action 19: MOVE \u2192 from (2,8) down to (3,8).  \n   \u2013 Action 20: MOVE \u2192 from (3,8) down to (4,8).  \n   \u2013 Action 21: LEFT \u2192 from DOWN, a LEFT turn makes you face RIGHT (toward the BOX at (4,9)).  \n   \u2013 Action 22: PICKUP \u2192 with the BOX now directly in front, you pick it up.\n\nThis 22-action plan satisfies all rules and completes the objective of retrieving the BOX from the other room."}
