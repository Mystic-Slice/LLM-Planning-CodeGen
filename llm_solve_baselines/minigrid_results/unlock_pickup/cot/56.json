Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nUP\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"DROP\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nLet's explain the reasoning step by step:\n\n1. Starting at (3,3) facing UP, the KEY is immediately below at (4,3). To have it directly in front, we turn 180\u00b0 to face DOWN. So we execute \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\".\n2. Now facing DOWN, the KEY is in the adjacent cell. We \"PICKUP\" it.\n3. With the KEY in hand, we need to get to the door at (2,5) (which connects the left room\u2014your starting room\u2014to the right room where the BOX is). From (3,3) (after picking up the KEY) we turn 180\u00b0 (with \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\") to face UP. Then we \"MOVE\" into (2,3).\n4. At (2,3) facing UP, turning \"RIGHT\" will make you face east. A subsequent \"MOVE\" brings you into (2,4), which is immediately adjacent (to the left) of the door at (2,5).\n5. Facing east, execute \"UNLOCK\" to unlock the door (using the KEY in hand) that lies directly in front.\n6. Now, \"MOVE\" from (2,4) into the door cell (2,5) and then \"MOVE\" further to (2,6) in the right room.\n7. Since you cannot PICKUP the BOX while holding an object, and your objective requires you to pick up the BOX, you must drop the KEY. With the agent at (2,6) facing EAST, the adjacent cell (2,7) is empty and suitable for a \"DROP\". So perform \"DROP\".\n8. Finally, the BOX is located at (1,6). To pick it up, you must be adjacent to it. From (2,6) the cell directly above (1,6) contains the BOX. Turn \"LEFT\" (from EAST, \"LEFT\" becomes NORTH) and then \"PICKUP\" the BOX.\n\nThis sequence of actions accomplishes the objective step by step."}
