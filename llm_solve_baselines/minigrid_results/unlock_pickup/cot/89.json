Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nDOWN\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"DROP\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the step\u2010by\u2010step reasoning:\n\n1. Starting at row4, col3 facing DOWN, we must get the KEY at row1, col3 without stepping into its cell (since you can only pick up objects from an adjacent cell). First, we turn to face UP by issuing two \"LEFT\" commands. Then, we move two steps upward\u2014from row4, col3 to row3, col3 and then to row2, col3. Now, facing UP, the cell in front (row1, col3) holds the KEY, so we \"PICKUP\" it.\n\n2. With the KEY in hand and at position row2, col3 facing UP, we need to go to the door at row4, col5 (which connects to the room where the BOX is). We turn 180\u00b0 (two \"LEFT\"s) to face DOWN and then move two steps downward to row4, col3. Next, to head east, we turn \"LEFT\" (from DOWN, that makes us face RIGHT) and \"MOVE\" into row4, col4. Now, with the door immediately to our right (row4, col5), we \"UNLOCK\" it using the KEY.\n\n3. After unlocking, we \"MOVE\" into the door cell (row4, col5). However, we cannot pick up the BOX while still holding the KEY. So, we must drop the KEY into an empty adjacent cell. Facing RIGHT (front cell row4, col6 contains the BOX and isn\u2019t empty), we rotate 180\u00b0 (two \"LEFT\"s) so that we face LEFT; then \"DROP\" the KEY into the empty cell at row4, col4.\n\n4. Finally, we need to pick up the BOX at row4, col6. To do this, we reorient from facing LEFT back to facing RIGHT (two \"LEFT\"s) and then \"PICKUP\" the BOX from the cell in front (row4, col6).\n\nThis sequence of actions meets all the game\u2019s rules and safely accomplishes the objective."}
