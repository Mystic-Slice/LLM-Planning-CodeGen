Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nRIGHT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n    [\"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"DROP\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the step\u2010by\u2010step plan:\n\n1. Start at [2,3] facing RIGHT.  \n\u2003\u2022 Turn RIGHT so you face DOWN.  \n\u2003\u2022 MOVE to [3,3] where the KEY is.  \n\u2003\u2022 PICKUP the KEY.\n\n2. With the KEY in hand but needing to unlock the door from the left side, go back toward the door at [1,5].  \n\u2003\u2022 While at [3,3] facing DOWN, turn LEFT twice to face UP.  \n\u2003\u2022 MOVE twice (first to [2,3], then to [1,3]).  \n\u2003\u2022 From [1,3] you need to head right toward [1,4] (the cell adjacent to the door). Turn RIGHT (from UP you face RIGHT) and MOVE to [1,4].\n\n3. To eventually pick up the BOX you must not be holding another object. So drop the KEY safely.  \n\u2003\u2022 At [1,4] facing RIGHT (with the door at [1,5] ahead, which you cannot drop into), turn LEFT twice to face LEFT.  \n\u2003\u2022 DROP the KEY into the empty cell [1,3].  \n\u2003\u2022 Then turn LEFT twice (rotating 180\u00b0) so that you are once again facing RIGHT.\n\n4. Now, with empty hands, use the KEY you just used to unlock the door.  \n\u2003\u2022 UNLOCK the door directly in front (cell [1,5]).  \n\u2003\u2022 MOVE into the door cell.\n\n5. Cross into the right-side room toward the BOX at [4,9].  \n\u2003\u2022 MOVE repeatedly to go right: from [1,5] to [1,6], then [1,7], then [1,8], and finally [1,9].  \n\u2003\u2022 At [1,9] facing RIGHT, turn RIGHT to face DOWN.\n\n6. Approach the BOX so that it is in the cell directly in front.  \n\u2003\u2022 MOVE down twice: from [1,9] to [2,9] and then to [3,9].  \n\u2003\u2022 Finally, PICKUP the BOX from the cell [4,9] (directly in front of you, as required).\n\nThis complete sequence of 24 actions achieves the objective step by step."}
