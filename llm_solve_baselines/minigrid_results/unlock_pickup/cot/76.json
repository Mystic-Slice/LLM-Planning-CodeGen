Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nUP\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"DROP\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nLet's explain the plan step by step:\n\n1. Starting at [1,3] facing UP, we first turn LEFT so that we face the KEY, which is located to our left.\n2. We MOVE forward from [1,3] to [1,2]. Now, facing left, the cell in front ([1,1]) contains the KEY.\n3. We execute PICKUP to grab the KEY.\n\nNow holding the KEY, we need to go unlock the door (located at [3,5]). We plan to approach it from the left side:\n4. From facing LEFT, a LEFT turn makes us face DOWN.\n5. MOVE from [1,2] to [2,2].\n6. From facing DOWN, a LEFT turn rotates us to face RIGHT.\n7. MOVE from [2,2] to [2,3].\n8. MOVE from [2,3] to [2,4].\n9. From facing RIGHT, a RIGHT turn makes us face DOWN.\n10. MOVE from [2,4] to [3,4]\u2014the cell immediately to the left of the door.\n11. From facing DOWN at [3,4], a LEFT turn will make us face RIGHT, so that the door ([3,5]) is directly in front.\n12. UNLOCK the door using the KEY we are holding.\n\nSince we cannot pick up the BOX while holding the KEY, we need to drop it into an empty adjacent cell. At [3,4] now facing RIGHT, the door is ahead (not permitted for dropping), so:\n13. Turn LEFT (now facing UP).\n14. Turn LEFT again (now facing LEFT) so that the adjacent cell in front ([3,3]) is empty.\n15. DROP the KEY into [3,3].\n\nWith the KEY safely dropped, our next goal is to move into the right room, where the BOX is. We reposition:\n16. From facing LEFT, a RIGHT turn makes us face UP.\n17. Another RIGHT turn sets us to face RIGHT.\n18. MOVE from [3,4] into the door cell at [3,5] (the door is now unlocked).\n19. MOVE from [3,5] to [3,6] in the right room.\n20. MOVE from [3,6] to [3,7]\u2014this positions us directly above the BOX.\n21. From facing RIGHT at [3,7], a RIGHT turn makes us face DOWN (so that the BOX located at [4,7] is directly in front).\n22. Finally, PICKUP the BOX.\n\nThis sequence accomplishes the objective of retrieving the BOX from the other room."}
