Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nRIGHT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n    [\"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Starting at (1,1) facing RIGHT, the agent needs to acquire the KEY (located at [3,3]) without entering the key\u2019s cell. Instead, the agent must stand adjacent so that the key is in the cell directly in front.\n2. Action 1 \u201cMOVE\u201d takes the agent from (1,1) to (1,2).\n3. Action 2 \u201cMOVE\u201d takes the agent from (1,2) to (1,3) \u2014 still facing RIGHT.\n4. Action 3 \u201cRIGHT\u201d turns the agent 90\u00b0 right to face DOWN.\n5. Action 4 \u201cMOVE\u201d advances the agent from (1,3) to (2,3). Now facing DOWN, the cell directly ahead (3,3) contains the KEY.\n6. Action 5 \u201cPICKUP\u201d picks up the KEY from the cell (3,3) without stepping on it.\n7. With the KEY in hand, the agent must now reach the DOOR (located at [4,5]) from the left side. It first moves into the cell from where the door is reachable.\n8. Action 6 \u201cMOVE\u201d goes from (2,3) to (3,3) (this cell is now empty after picking up the KEY).\n9. Action 7 \u201cMOVE\u201d continues from (3,3) to (4,3), still moving DOWN.\n10. Action 8 \u201cLEFT\u201d rotates the agent from facing DOWN to facing RIGHT.\n11. Action 9 \u201cMOVE\u201d takes the agent from (4,3) to (4,4). Now, with the agent facing RIGHT, the door at (4,5) is immediately in front.\n12. Action 10 \u201cUNLOCK\u201d uses the held KEY to unlock the DOOR at (4,5).\n13. The agent then moves through the door into the right room where the BOX is located.\n14. Action 11 \u201cMOVE\u201d moves from (4,4) into the now-unlocked door cell (4,5).\n15. Action 12 \u201cMOVE\u201d goes from (4,5) to (4,6), advancing further into the right room.\n16. The agent now needs to head upward toward the BOX at (1,8). Since it\u2019s currently facing RIGHT, it must reorient.\n17. Action 13 \u201cLEFT\u201d changes the facing from RIGHT to UP.\n18. Actions 14\u201316 \u201cMOVE\u201d take the agent step-by-step upward from (4,6) to (3,6), then to (2,6), and finally to (1,6) while facing UP.\n19. At (1,6) the agent must now face east to be adjacent to the BOX at (1,8).\n20. Action 17 \u201cRIGHT\u201d turns the agent from facing UP to facing RIGHT.\n21. Action 18 \u201cMOVE\u201d advances the agent from (1,6) to (1,7). Now, with the BOX at (1,8) directly in front,\n22. Action 19 \u201cPICKUP\u201d picks up the BOX, completing the objective.\n\nThis sequence fulfills the rules and objectives in the grid-based environment."}
