Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nRIGHT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nLet\u2019s explain the plan step by step:\n\n1. Starting at (1,4) facing RIGHT, we want to go to the KEY at (3,1) without entering its cell (because objects block movement). We choose to approach the KEY from above. First, we turn from RIGHT to LEFT by turning LEFT twice.  \n   \u2022 Actions: \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\"\n\n2. Now facing LEFT, we move three times from (1,4) \u2192 (1,3) \u2192 (1,2) \u2192 (1,1).  \n   \u2022 Actions: \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"\n\n3. Next, from (1,1) we need to get below because our target KEY at (3,1) lies beneath. Facing LEFT, we turn LEFT to face DOWN.  \n   \u2022 Action: \"LEFT\"\n\n4. We move once to (2,1). Now the KEY is directly in front (cell (3,1)).  \n   \u2022 Action: \"MOVE\"\n\n5. We pick up the KEY. (Note that once picked up, the key\u2019s cell becomes empty.)  \n   \u2022 Action: \"PICKUP\"\n\n6. With the KEY in hand, we now need to go to the DOOR at (4,5) that separates the left room from the right room (where the BOX is located).  \n   From (2,1) (facing DOWN), we move down two steps: from (2,1) to (3,1) then to (4,1).  \n   \u2022 Actions: \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"\n\n7. At (4,1) still facing DOWN, we need to head east. From DOWN, turning LEFT makes us face RIGHT.  \n   \u2022 Action: \"LEFT\"\n\n8. Then we move three times to the right from (4,1) \u2192 (4,2) \u2192 (4,3) \u2192 (4,4).  \n   \u2022 Actions: \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"\n\n9. Now at (4,4) facing RIGHT, the DOOR is directly ahead at (4,5). We unlock it using our KEY.  \n   \u2022 Action: \"UNLOCK\"\n\n10. We then move into the door cell (now unlocked) by moving one step to (4,5).  \n    \u2022 Action: \"MOVE\"\n\n11. To enter the right room, we continue moving RIGHT from (4,5) to (4,6).  \n    \u2022 Action: \"MOVE\"\n\n12. Inside the right room, we must navigate to the BOX at (1,9). We'll approach it so that the BOX is directly in front of us for a pickup. From (4,6) facing RIGHT, turning LEFT makes us face UP.  \n    \u2022 Action: \"LEFT\"\n\n13. Moving up three times takes us from (4,6) \u2192 (3,6) \u2192 (2,6) \u2192 (1,6).  \n    \u2022 Actions: \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"\n\n14. At (1,6) facing UP, we turn RIGHT to face EAST (to get closer to the BOX, which is to our right).  \n    \u2022 Action: \"RIGHT\"\n\n15. Then we move right twice from (1,6) \u2192 (1,7) \u2192 (1,8). Now the BOX, located at (1,9), is directly in front of us.  \n    \u2022 Actions: \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"\n\n16. Finally, we pick up the BOX.  \n    \u2022 Action: \"PICKUP\"\n\nThis sequence of 25 actions satisfies the objective."}
