Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nDOWN\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Starting at [4,1] facing DOWN, we need to get adjacent to the KEY at [3,2]. To do so without stepping on it, we first turn so that we can stand at [3,1] and face east toward [3,2].\n   - \"LEFT\" then \"LEFT\": from DOWN, first LEFT makes you face EAST, second LEFT makes you face NORTH.\n2. \"MOVE\": from [4,1] to [3,1] (now facing NORTH).\n3. Now turn to face EAST (so that [3,2] is in front):\n   - \"RIGHT\": from NORTH, turning right gives EAST.\n4. \"PICKUP\": while at [3,1] facing EAST, you pick up the KEY from the cell at [3,2].\n5. With the KEY in hand, navigate to the door at [3,5] by moving east:\n   - \"MOVE\": from [3,1] to [3,2].\n   - \"MOVE\": from [3,2] to [3,3].\n   - \"MOVE\": from [3,3] to [3,4].\n6. At [3,4] facing EAST, \"UNLOCK\" the door directly in front at [3,5].\n7. \"MOVE\": step into the now unlocked door cell at [3,5].\n8. \"MOVE\": continue east into the adjacent right room at [3,6].\n9. Next, navigate to a position from which you can pick up the BOX at [1,7]. A convenient plan is to approach the BOX from the west while positioned at [1,6]:\n   - \"LEFT\": from facing EAST, a LEFT turn changes your direction to NORTH.\n   - \"MOVE\": from [3,6] to [2,6].\n   - \"MOVE\": from [2,6] to [1,6].\n10. Now face EAST to have the BOX in your front:\n    - \"RIGHT\": turning from NORTH to EAST.\n11. \"PICKUP\": while at [1,6] facing EAST, you pick up the BOX from [1,7].\n\nThis sequence satisfies the objective of picking up the BOX in the other room."}
