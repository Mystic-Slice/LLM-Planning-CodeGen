Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"WALL\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nDOWN\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n    [\"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"DROP\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nLet's explain step by step:\n\n1. Starting at (1,4) facing DOWN, we need to get the KEY at (1,2). Since from DOWN a RIGHT turn makes the agent face WEST (which is the direction needed to approach the KEY), we do:\n   - \"RIGHT\": Now facing WEST.\n2. \"MOVE\": From (1,4) \u2192 (1,3). Now the agent stands just to the right of the KEY.\n3. \"PICKUP\": With the KEY in cell (1,2) directly in front (to the west), the agent picks up the KEY.\n   \n4. Now, with the KEY in hand, we must leave the left room by unlocking the door. We plan a route from the current (1,3):\n   - \"LEFT\": While facing WEST, a LEFT turn (90\u00b0 counterclockwise) makes the agent face SOUTH.\n5. \"MOVE\": From (1,3) \u2192 (2,3).\n6. \"LEFT\": Facing SOUTH, a LEFT turn makes the agent face EAST.\n7. \"MOVE\": From (2,3) \u2192 (2,4). Now the door cell is right in front at (2,5).\n\n8. \"UNLOCK\": With the KEY in hand and the door (at (2,5)) directly ahead, the agent unlocks it. The door is now passable.\n9. \"MOVE\": Step into the former door cell: from (2,4) \u2192 (2,5) while still facing EAST.\n10. \"MOVE\": Continue moving EAST from (2,5) \u2192 (2,6).\n\n11. At this point, the agent is holding the KEY but needs free hands to pick up the BOX later. Since the KEY is no longer needed, the agent drops it. The agent does so by dropping it in the cell directly ahead (cell (2,7)), which is empty:\n    - \"DROP\": KEY is dropped into (2,7).\n\n12. Now facing EAST at (2,6), the BOX lies in (1,6) (directly north of (2,6)). So the agent turns:\n    - \"LEFT\": From EAST, a LEFT turn makes the agent face NORTH.\n13. Finally, \"PICKUP\": With the BOX in cell (1,6) directly ahead, the agent picks up the BOX\u2014achieving the objective.\n\nThis completes the action list."}
