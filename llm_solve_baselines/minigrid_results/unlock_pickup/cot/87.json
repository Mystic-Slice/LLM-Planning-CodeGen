Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nLEFT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nStep-by-step Explanation:\n\n1. Starting at (4,1) facing LEFT:\n   - \"RIGHT\": turn from LEFT to face UP.\n2. \"MOVE\": go up from (4,1) to (3,1).\n3. \"MOVE\": go up from (3,1) to (2,1).\n4. \"RIGHT\": from facing UP, turn right to face RIGHT.\n5. \"PICKUP\": with agent at (2,1) facing RIGHT, the cell ahead (2,2) contains the KEY.\n   The agent picks up the KEY.\n\n6. Now holding the KEY, still at (2,1) and facing RIGHT, we need to reach the door at (3,5). \n   \"MOVE\": from (2,1) to (2,2).\n7. \"MOVE\": from (2,2) to (2,3).\n8. \"MOVE\": from (2,3) to (2,4).\n\n9. \"RIGHT\": while facing RIGHT, turn right to face DOWN.\n10. \"MOVE\": from (2,4) to (3,4) (cell left-adjacent to door).\n11. \"LEFT\": from DOWN, turn left to face RIGHT (toward the door at (3,5)).\n12. \"UNLOCK\": unlock the door at (3,5) (adjacent cell in front) using the KEY.\n\n13. \"MOVE\": step into the (formerly door) cell at (3,5).\n\n14. Now in the adjacent room where the BOX is located (at (1,8)):\n    \"MOVE\": from (3,5) to (3,6).\n15. \"MOVE\": from (3,6) to (3,7).\n16. \"MOVE\": from (3,7) to (3,8).\n\n17. \"LEFT\": while facing RIGHT, turn left to face UP.\n18. \"MOVE\": from (3,8) to (2,8); now the cell in front (1,8) contains the BOX.\n19. \"PICKUP\": pick up the BOX from the cell directly ahead.\n\nThis sequence completes the objective of picking up the BOX located in a different room."}
