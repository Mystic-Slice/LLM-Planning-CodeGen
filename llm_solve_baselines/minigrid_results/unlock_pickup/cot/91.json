Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nRIGHT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the step\u2010by\u2010step reasoning:\n\n1. With the agent starting at [1,3] facing RIGHT, we first need to go to the KEY at [4,1]. Since the KEY is to the southwest, we face WEST first. Two LEFT turns change the direction from RIGHT to WEST.\n2. A MOVE takes us from [1,3] to [1,2]. Then a LEFT turn (from WEST) directs us SOUTH.\n3. Three consecutive MOVEs take us from [1,2] \u2192 [2,2] \u2192 [3,2] \u2192 [4,2].\n4. A RIGHT turn (from SOUTH) points us back WEST so that the cell in front ([4,1]) has the KEY. A PICKUP collects the KEY.\n5. Now, with the KEY in hand (and still at [4,2]), we must reach the door at [3,5] to unlock it. A RIGHT turn from WEST makes us face NORTH.\n6. A MOVE takes us from [4,2] to [3,2]. Then a RIGHT turn (from NORTH) sets our direction to EAST.\n7. Two MOVEs take us from [3,2] to [3,3] and then to [3,4]. Standing at [3,4] facing EAST, the door at [3,5] is directly ahead.\n8. An UNLOCK action (while holding the KEY) unlocks the door. A subsequent MOVE enters the door cell ([3,5]), switching into the room with the BOX.\n9. In the right room the BOX is located at [1,9]. From [3,5] still facing EAST, three MOVEs take us to [3,6] \u2192 [3,7] \u2192 [3,8].\n10. A LEFT turn (from EAST) points us NORTH. Two MOVEs then bring us from [3,8] to [2,8] and finally to [1,8].\n11. At [1,8] facing NORTH, a RIGHT turn makes us face EAST so that the BOX at [1,9] is directly in front.\n12. A final PICKUP action collects the BOX.\n\nThis sequence of actions accomplishes the objective step by step."}
