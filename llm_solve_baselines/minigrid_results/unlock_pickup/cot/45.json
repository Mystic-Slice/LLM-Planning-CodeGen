Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nUP\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the step\u2010by\u2010step reasoning:\n\n1. Starting at (3,4) facing UP, we need to grab the KEY at (2,3).  \n   \u2022 TURN LEFT to face LEFT.  \n   \u2022 MOVE from (3,4) to (3,3).  \n   \u2022 TURN RIGHT to face UP so that the cell in front becomes (2,3).  \n   \u2022 PICKUP the KEY.\n\n2. Now holding the KEY, our goal is to unlock the DOOR at (4,5) so that we can reach the BOX at (4,9). We want to approach the door from the left side (cell (4,4)) with our agent facing RIGHT.  \n   \u2022 From (3,3) (facing UP), TURN LEFT twice to face DOWN.  \n   \u2022 MOVE down from (3,3) to (4,3).  \n   \u2022 TURN LEFT (from DOWN, a left turn points us RIGHT).  \n   \u2022 MOVE from (4,3) to (4,4).\n\n3. With the agent at (4,4) facing RIGHT, the cell in front is (4,5) which holds the DOOR.  \n   \u2022 UNLOCK the DOOR.\n\n4. With the door unlocked (thus considered empty), we can now proceed into the room containing the BOX. We want to approach the BOX from (4,8) facing RIGHT.  \n   \u2022 MOVE from (4,4) to (4,5) (through the door).  \n   \u2022 MOVE from (4,5) to (4,6).  \n   \u2022 MOVE from (4,6) to (4,7).  \n   \u2022 MOVE from (4,7) to (4,8).\n\n5. Finally, with the BOX at (4,9) directly ahead,  \n   \u2022 PICKUP the BOX.\n\nThis sequence of actions successfully picks up the KEY, unlocks the door, navigates through, and then picks up the BOX in the other room."}
