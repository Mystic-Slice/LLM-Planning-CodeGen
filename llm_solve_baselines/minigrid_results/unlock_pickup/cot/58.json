Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nDOWN\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n    [\"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Starting at (3,3) facing DOWN, we need to get the KEY at (2,1). To go left (west), we turn RIGHT (since from DOWN, a right turn points WEST).\n2. We MOVE from (3,3) to (3,2), then MOVE again to (3,1).\n3. At (3,1), to have the KEY (located in the cell above at (2,1)) in front, we turn RIGHT so we face NORTH.\n4. We then execute PICKUP to pick up the KEY from (2,1) (the cell directly in front).\n5. With the KEY, we now want to head toward the door at (3,5) so we must navigate from (3,1) back into the hallway. Turning RIGHT (from NORTH) sets our direction to EAST.\n6. We MOVE east three times: from (3,1) to (3,2), then (3,3), and finally (3,4). Now we face the door (at (3,5)) directly ahead.\n7. We use UNLOCK (with the KEY held) to unlock the DOOR at (3,5).\n8. We MOVE into the door at (3,5) and continue moving east into the adjacent room.\n9. In the second room, we move EAST two more times to reach (3,7).\n10. Then, turning LEFT (from EAST) points us NORTH. We MOVE from (3,7) to (2,7).\n11. To get closer to the BOX at (1,8), we turn RIGHT (from NORTH) to face EAST and MOVE to (2,8).\n12. Finally, turning LEFT adjusts our facing to NORTH so we can PICKUP the BOX, which is located in the cell above (1,8).\n\nThis sequence of actions satisfies the objective of picking up the BOX in the other room."}
