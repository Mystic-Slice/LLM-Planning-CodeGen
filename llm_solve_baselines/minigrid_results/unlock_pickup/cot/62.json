Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nLEFT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"RIGHT\", \"DROP\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the step\u2010by\u2010step reasoning:\n\n1. Start at (4,1) facing LEFT. To head toward the KEY at (3,4), first turn right so you face UP.\n2. MOVE from (4,1) to (3,1) (facing UP).\n3. Turn RIGHT to face EAST.\n4. MOVE from (3,1) to (3,2).\n5. MOVE from (3,2) to (3,3).\n6. With the KEY located in the cell directly in front ((3,4)), use PICKUP to retrieve the KEY.\n7. After picking up the KEY, turn LEFT from facing RIGHT to face UP.\n8. MOVE from (3,3) to (2,3).\n9. Turn RIGHT so you face EAST.\n10. MOVE from (2,3) to (2,4). Now, the DOOR is directly in front at (2,5).\n11. Use UNLOCK (while holding the KEY) to unlock the DOOR.\n12. Turn RIGHT (from EAST to face DOWN).\n13. DROP the KEY into the cell in front ((3,4) becomes the drop location) so you free your hand.\n14. Turn LEFT from facing DOWN to face RIGHT.\n15. MOVE from (2,4) to (2,5) (through the now-unlocked door cell).\n16. MOVE from (2,5) to (2,6) entering the right room.\n17. Turn RIGHT (from facing RIGHT to face DOWN) to start heading toward the BOX.\n18. MOVE from (2,6) to (3,6).\n19. MOVE from (3,6) to (4,6).\n20. Turn LEFT (from facing DOWN to face RIGHT).\n21. MOVE from (4,6) to (4,7).\n22. MOVE from (4,7) to (4,8).\n23. Finally, from (4,8) facing RIGHT, the BOX is directly in front at (4,9). Use PICKUP to pick up the BOX.\n\nThis series of actions completes the objective of retrieving the BOX from the other room."}
