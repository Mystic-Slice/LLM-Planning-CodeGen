Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nRIGHT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"LEFT\", \"DROP\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the step\u2010by\u2010step reasoning:\n\n1. Starting at (2,2) facing RIGHT.\n2. \"MOVE\" \u2192 Agent moves to (2,3).\n3. \"MOVE\" \u2192 Agent moves to (2,4). (Now directly above the cell (3,4) which holds the KEY.)\n4. \"RIGHT\" \u2192 Agent turns from RIGHT to face DOWN.\n5. \"PICKUP\" \u2192 Facing DOWN, the cell in front (3,4) contains the KEY. Agent picks up the KEY.\n6. \"MOVE\" \u2192 With the KEY, agent moves from (2,4) down to (3,4).\n7. \"LEFT\" \u2192 Now at (3,4) facing DOWN, a LEFT turn makes the agent face RIGHT, toward the DOOR at (3,5).\n8. \"UNLOCK\" \u2192 Facing the DOOR at (3,5) and holding the KEY, the agent unlocks it. (The door cell becomes accessible, but the agent still holds the KEY.)\n9. To obey the rule that you cannot pick up another object while holding an object, the KEY must now be dropped into an eligible empty cell. At (3,4) facing RIGHT, the cell ahead (3,5) would be invalid (a door cell), so:\n10. \"LEFT\" \u2192 Turn from RIGHT to face UP. Now the cell in front (2,4) is empty.\n11. \"DROP\" \u2192 Drop the KEY into (2,4). (Now, the agent is no longer holding anything.)\n12. The agent now must head towards the BOX, which is in the room beyond the door. From (3,4) facing UP, the agent reorients:\n13. \"RIGHT\" \u2192 From UP, turning RIGHT makes the agent face RIGHT.\n14. \"MOVE\" \u2192 Move from (3,4) to (3,5) (through the unlocked door).\n15. \"MOVE\" \u2192 Move from (3,5) to (3,6).\n16. \"RIGHT\" \u2192 At (3,6) facing RIGHT, a RIGHT turn makes the agent face DOWN. Now the cell in front (4,6) contains the BOX.\n17. \"PICKUP\" \u2192 Pick up the BOX from (4,6).\n\nThis sequence satisfies all the constraints and completes the objective of picking up the BOX in the other room."}
