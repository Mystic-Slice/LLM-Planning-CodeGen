Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nUP\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's a step\u2010by\u2010step explanation:\n\n1. Starting at row2, col1 facing UP, we need to fetch the KEY at row4, col3 (without stepping into its cell).  \n   \u2022 \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\" rotates the agent from UP to DOWN.  \n   \u2022 Two \"MOVE\" actions bring the agent from row2, col1 to row4, col1.  \n   \u2022 \"LEFT\" (while facing DOWN) turns the agent to face EAST.  \n   \u2022 \"MOVE\" takes the agent to row4, col2\u2014adjacent to the KEY at row4, col3.  \n   \u2022 \"PICKUP\" collects the KEY from the cell directly in front (row4, col3).\n\n2. With the KEY in hand, the agent must now go to the door at row1, col5 (by approaching from row1, col4 facing east).  \n   \u2022 \"LEFT\" turns the agent (from EAST) to face NORTH.  \n   \u2022 Three \"MOVE\" actions take the agent from row4, col2 up to row1, col2.  \n   \u2022 \"RIGHT\" rotates the agent to face EAST.  \n   \u2022 Two \"MOVE\" actions bring the agent to row1, col4, which is adjacent to the door (cell row1, col5).  \n   \u2022 \"UNLOCK\" uses the KEY to unlock the door directly in front.\n\n3. Crossing into the room with the BOX (located at row2, col9):  \n   \u2022 \"MOVE\" enters the door cell (row1, col5).  \n   \u2022 \"MOVE\" continues into the right room (to row1, col6).\n\n4. Now to reach and pick up the BOX:  \n   \u2022 \"RIGHT\" rotates the agent from EAST to face SOUTH.  \n   \u2022 \"MOVE\" steps down from row1, col6 to row2, col6.  \n   \u2022 \"LEFT\" turns the agent from SOUTH to face EAST.  \n   \u2022 Two \"MOVE\" actions progress the agent to row2, col8, which is adjacent to the BOX in row2, col9.  \n   \u2022 Finally, \"PICKUP\" collects the BOX.\n\nThis complete action sequence meets the objective by first obtaining the KEY and unlocking the door, then entering the box\u2019s room and picking up the BOX."}
