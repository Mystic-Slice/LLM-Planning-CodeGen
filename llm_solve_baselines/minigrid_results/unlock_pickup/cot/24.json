Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nLEFT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"DROP\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nLet's explain the reasoning step by step:\n\n1. Starting at (3,3) facing LEFT, we first need the KEY that is in the cell above ((2,3)). Since the KEY is directly North of the agent, we turn RIGHT (from LEFT, a RIGHT turn points UP) so that we face the KEY. \n\u2003\u2003Action: \"RIGHT\"\n\n2. With the key now in the cell directly ahead ((2,3)), we use the PICKUP action to grab the KEY. Note that the agent remains in its cell after PICKUP.\n\u2003\u2003Action: \"PICKUP\"\n\n3. Next, we move into the now-empty cell from which we picked up the KEY. Since we are facing UP, we MOVE from (3,3) to (2,3).\n\u2003\u2003Action: \"MOVE\"\n\n4. In order to unlock the door later, we have to bring the KEY to the door. The door is at (2,5), so first we need to head in the rightward direction. From (2,3) facing UP, turning RIGHT now makes the agent face RIGHT.\n\u2003\u2003Action: \"RIGHT\"\n\n5. We then MOVE from (2,3) to (2,4) so that the door will be right in front of us.\n\u2003\u2003Action: \"MOVE\"\n\n6. Facing RIGHT at (2,4), the cell directly ahead ((2,5)) is the DOOR. With the KEY in hand we perform \"UNLOCK\" to open the door.\n\u2003\u2003Action: \"UNLOCK\"\n\n7. Now, still at (2,4) but facing RIGHT, we cannot drop the KEY in front because (2,5) is a door cell (dropping is disallowed into door cells). We need to drop the KEY into an empty cell. We choose (2,3)\u2014the cell behind us if we face LEFT. So we first turn left twice:\n\u2003\u2003Action: \"LEFT\" (turning from RIGHT to UP)\n\u2003\u2003Action: \"LEFT\" (turning from UP to LEFT)\n\n8. With the agent now at (2,4) facing LEFT, the cell directly in front is (2,3), which is empty. We DROP the KEY there.\n\u2003\u2003Action: \"DROP\"\n\n9. To ultimately reach the BOX (which is at (2,9) in the right room), we have to traverse through the door. We are at (2,4) facing LEFT; to approach the door (which lies to our right from our previous orientation), we must reorient to face RIGHT. A 180\u00b0 change can be done by two left turns:\n\u2003\u2003Action: \"LEFT\" (turning from LEFT to SOUTH)\n\u2003\u2003Action: \"LEFT\" (turning from SOUTH to RIGHT)\n\n10. Now facing RIGHT at (2,4), we MOVE step by step:\n\u2003\u2003- MOVE from (2,4) to (2,5) through the now-unlocked door.\n\u2003\u2003\u2003Action: \"MOVE\"\n\u2003\u2003- MOVE from (2,5) to (2,6).\n\u2003\u2003\u2003Action: \"MOVE\"\n\u2003\u2003- MOVE from (2,6) to (2,7).\n\u2003\u2003\u2003Action: \"MOVE\"\n\u2003\u2003- MOVE from (2,7) to (2,8), so that the BOX at (2,9) is directly ahead.\n\u2003\u2003\u2003Action: \"MOVE\"\n\n11. Finally, with the BOX directly in front at (2,9) and not having anything in our hand, we PICKUP the BOX.\n\u2003\u2003Action: \"PICKUP\"\n\nThis sequence of actions satisfies the objective: retrieve the BOX from the adjacent room by first picking up the KEY, unlocking the door, dropping the KEY (since you can only hold one object at a time), and then picking up the BOX."}
