Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nRIGHT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n  [\"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"RIGHT\", \"DROP\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nLet's explain the plan step by step:\n\n1. Starting at [1,2] facing RIGHT, we first turn RIGHT to face DOWN.\n2. MOVE from [1,2] to [2,2].\n3. From [2,2] facing DOWN, the cell ahead ([3,2]) holds the KEY. So we execute PICKUP to grab the KEY (without entering the KEY\u2019s cell).\n4. MOVE from [2,2] to [3,2] (now the KEY is in our inventory).\n5. Turn LEFT from DOWN to face RIGHT.\n6. MOVE from [3,2] to [3,3].\n7. MOVE from [3,3] to [3,4]. Now we\u2019re adjacent to the DOOR at [3,5].\n8. With the KEY in hand, execute UNLOCK to unlock the door.\n9. We now need to free our hands (since we can only hold one object) before picking up the BOX. Turn RIGHT from facing RIGHT to face DOWN.\n10. DROP the KEY into the empty cell [4,4] (directly in front while facing DOWN).\n11. To approach the BOX, turn LEFT to face RIGHT.\n12. MOVE into the door cell [3,5].\n13. Finally, from [3,5] facing RIGHT, PICKUP the BOX located at [3,6].\n\nThis sequence meets all the rules and achieves the goal of picking up the BOX located in the other room."}
