Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nRIGHT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n    [\"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"LEFT\", \"DROP\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nLet's explain step\u2010by\u2010step:\n\n1. Starting at (2,2) facing RIGHT, the agent first moves one step to (2,3).\n2. A LEFT turn makes the agent face UP so the KEY, located at (1,3) (directly ahead), can be picked up.\n3. The agent picks up the KEY.\n4\u20135. To head toward the door\u2019s drop zone, the agent turns from UP to DOWN by two RIGHT turns.\n6\u20137. Two MOVE actions bring the agent from (2,3) down to (3,3) then to (4,3).\n8. A LEFT turn from DOWN makes the agent face RIGHT.\n9. A MOVE places the agent at (4,4); (4,4) is adjacent to the door (which is at (4,5)).\n10. With the KEY in hand and facing the door, the agent performs UNLOCK to open the door.\n11\u201312. To free up space for picking up the BOX later (since the agent can hold only one object), the agent turns LEFT (changing direction from RIGHT to UP) and then uses DROP to leave the KEY in an empty cell (at (3,4)).\n13. The agent turns RIGHT from UP to face RIGHT\u2014preparing to cross the door.\n14. A MOVE step enters the unlocked door cell at (4,5).\n15. Another MOVE proceeds to (4,6) in the new room.\n16. A LEFT turn changes the orientation from RIGHT to UP.\n17. A MOVE brings the agent from (4,6) to (3,6) so that the BOX will be directly ahead.\n18. Finally, a PICKUP retrieves the BOX (located at (2,6)), completing the objective.\n  \nThis sequence navigates from the starting room, collects the KEY, unlocks the door, drops the KEY (so as to be free to pick up the BOX), and then reaches and picks up the BOX in the other room."}
