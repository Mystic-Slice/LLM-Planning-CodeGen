Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nRIGHT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "We start at cell (4,1) facing RIGHT. Notice that the key is just above us at (3,1), so we first need to reorient upward and pick it up. Then, with the KEY in hand, we must go to the door (at (1,5)) to unlock it so we can access the other room where the BOX is (located at (2,6)). However, because we already hold the KEY and you cannot pick up another object while holding one, you must drop the KEY in an empty cell (we choose cell (2,4)) before attempting to pick up the BOX.\n\nHere is the step\u2010by\u2010step plan:\n\n1. Begin at (4,1) facing RIGHT.\n   \u2022 Turn LEFT so you face UP.\n   \u2022 With the key now in the cell in front (3,1), perform PICKUP to get the KEY.\n\n2. Move from (4,1) to the door approach:\n   \u2022 MOVE upward from (4,1) to (3,1) (the key\u2019s cell, now empty after pickup).\n   \u2022 MOVE to (2,1).\n   \u2022 MOVE to (1,1).\n\n3. At (1,1) facing UP, turn RIGHT so you face RIGHT. Then, walk right along row 1 toward the door:\n   \u2022 MOVE to (1,2).\n   \u2022 MOVE to (1,3).\n   \u2022 MOVE to (1,4). Now the door at (1,5) is directly in front.\n\n4. With the KEY in hand, use UNLOCK to unlock the door (at (1,5)). You still hold the KEY.\n\n5. Since you cannot pick up the BOX while holding the KEY, turn to drop it:\n   \u2022 From (1,4) (still facing RIGHT), turn RIGHT to face DOWN.\n   \u2022 Then DROP the KEY into (2,4) (which is empty).\n\n6. Now, to enter the right room:\n   \u2022 From (1,4) facing DOWN, turn LEFT (so you face RIGHT).\n   \u2022 MOVE into the unlocked door cell (1,5).\n\n7. In the right room, continue:\n   \u2022 MOVE from (1,5) to (1,6) while facing RIGHT.\n   \u2022 Turn RIGHT (from RIGHT, this makes you face DOWN).\n   \u2022 Now the cell in front (2,6) contains the BOX.\n   \u2022 Perform PICKUP to collect the BOX.\n\nBelow is the list of actions that follow this plan:\n\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"RIGHT\", \"DROP\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>"}
