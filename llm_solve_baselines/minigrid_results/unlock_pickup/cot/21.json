Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nLEFT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"LEFT\", \"DROP\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nLet's explain our reasoning step by step:\n\n1. Starting at row 4, column 1 facing LEFT, we must first get the KEY (located at [3,3]). Since we want to pick it up from an adjacent cell, we reorient and move:\n   - \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\": from LEFT to UP then to RIGHT.\n   - \"MOVE\": step from (4,1) to (4,2).\n   - \"LEFT\": turn from RIGHT to UP.\n   - \"MOVE\": move up from (4,2) to (3,2).\n   - \"RIGHT\": turn from UP to RIGHT so the cell ahead ([3,3]) contains the KEY.\n   - \"PICKUP\": pick up the KEY at (3,3).\n\n2. With the KEY in hand, our next goal is to unlock the door between rooms (the door is at [2,5]). We must approach it from the left side.\n   - \"MOVE\": from (3,2) facing RIGHT to (3,3).\n   - \"MOVE\": then from (3,3) to (3,4).\n   - \"LEFT\": turn from RIGHT to UP.\n   - \"MOVE\": go up from (3,4) to (2,4) \u2013 this cell is immediately left of the door.\n   - \"RIGHT\": turn from UP to RIGHT so that the door at (2,5) is directly in front.\n   - \"UNLOCK\": unlock the door (using our KEY).\n\n3. Now that the door is unlocked, we still hold the KEY, but we cannot pick up the BOX while holding an object. We must drop the KEY in an empty cell.\n   - \"LEFT\": from (2,4) facing RIGHT, we turn LEFT to face UP. Now the cell in front, (1,4), is empty.\n   - \"DROP\": drop the KEY into (1,4).\n\n4. With no object held, we can proceed through the door into the room containing the BOX (located at [4,7]). We first reorient and move into the door cell:\n   - \"RIGHT\": turn from UP to RIGHT.\n   - \"MOVE\": move from (2,4) into the door cell (2,5).\n\n5. Finally, we navigate from the door cell to a spot adjacent to the BOX so we can pick it up:\n   - \"MOVE\": from (2,5) to (2,6) while facing RIGHT.\n   - \"RIGHT\": turn from RIGHT to face DOWN.\n   - \"MOVE\": move down from (2,6) to (3,6).\n   - \"MOVE\": move down from (3,6) to (4,6).\n   - \"LEFT\": from DOWN, turn LEFT to face RIGHT so that the BOX at (4,7) is directly ahead.\n   - \"PICKUP\": pick up the BOX.\n\nThis sequence of 23 actions satisfies the objective."}
