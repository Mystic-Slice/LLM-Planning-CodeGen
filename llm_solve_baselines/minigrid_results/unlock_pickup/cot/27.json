Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nRIGHT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"DROP\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nBelow is the detailed reasoning:\n\n1. Starting at (4,4) facing RIGHT, we first need to get the KEY at (2,1) without entering its cell since objects block movement.\n   \u2022 \"LEFT\": Turn left so you face UP.\n   \u2022 \"MOVE\": Step from (4,4) to (3,4).\n   \u2022 \"LEFT\": Turn left to face LEFT.\n   \u2022 \"MOVE\": Move to (3,3).\n   \u2022 \"MOVE\": Move to (3,2).\n   \u2022 \"RIGHT\": Turn right from facing LEFT to face UP.\n   \u2022 \"MOVE\": Advance to (2,2).\n   \u2022 \"LEFT\": Turn left so you now face LEFT; the KEY lies directly left at (2,1).\n   \u2022 \"PICKUP\": Pick up the KEY from (2,1).\n\n2. Now holding the KEY, you must unlock the door at (1,5) that separates the left room (where you are) from the right room (where the BOX is). To do so, navigate to a cell adjacent to the door such that unlocking is possible:\n   \u2022 \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\": These two turns (by turning right twice) change your orientation from LEFT (after picking up the KEY) to RIGHT.\n   \u2022 \"MOVE\": From (2,2) move east to (2,3).\n   \u2022 \"MOVE\": Move east to (2,4).\n   \u2022 \"LEFT\": Turn left (from RIGHT) to face UP.\n   \u2022 \"MOVE\": Move north to (1,4). (Now (1,5) \u2014 the door cell \u2014 will be directly in front after you face RIGHT.)\n   \u2022 \"RIGHT\": Turn right to face RIGHT.\n   \u2022 \"UNLOCK\": Unlock the door at (1,5).\n\n3. You now want to pick up the BOX, but you cannot pick it up while holding the KEY. Therefore, drop the KEY into an empty cell.\n   \u2022 To drop the KEY, choose an adjacent empty cell that isn\u2019t a DOOR or WALL. From (1,4), turning around to face WEST makes the cell (1,3) a valid drop location.\n   \u2022 \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\": Two left turns change your orientation from RIGHT to LEFT.\n   \u2022 \"DROP\": Drop the KEY into (1,3).\n\n4. Finally, head into the right room and pick up the BOX:\n   \u2022 \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\": Two right turns reorient you from LEFT back to RIGHT.\n   \u2022 \"MOVE\": Move from (1,4) into the door cell at (1,5).\n   \u2022 \"PICKUP\": With the BOX now directly ahead in cell (1,6), pick it up.\n\nThis sequence of actions meets all the rules and accomplishes the goal of picking up the BOX located in the separate room."}
