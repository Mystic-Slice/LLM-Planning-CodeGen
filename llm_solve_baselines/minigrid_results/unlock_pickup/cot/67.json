Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nRIGHT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"DROP\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the step\u2010by\u2010step explanation:\n\n1. You start at (2,2) facing RIGHT.  \n   \u2022 \"MOVE\" takes you from (2,2) to (2,3).\n\n2. Now still at (2,3) facing RIGHT, you need to go downward toward the KEY at (4,3).  \n   \u2022 \"RIGHT\" turns you from facing RIGHT to DOWN.\n\n3. \"MOVE\" brings you from (2,3) to (3,3). Now, while at (3,3) facing DOWN, the cell directly in front, (4,3), holds the KEY.\n\n4. \"PICKUP\" picks up the KEY from (4,3) without stepping into its cell (this is allowed since the object is directly in front).\n\n5. Now holding the KEY, \"MOVE\" (while still facing DOWN) moves you into the now-empty cell (4,3).\n\n6. At (4,3) facing DOWN, you need to head toward the door.  \n   \u2022 \"LEFT\" turns you from DOWN to facing RIGHT.\n\n7. \"MOVE\" moves you from (4,3) to (4,4). The door is in the cell directly in front (at (4,5)).\n\n8. \"UNLOCK\" uses your held KEY to unlock the DOOR at (4,5).\n\n9\u201310. After unlocking, you cannot pick up the BOX while holding the KEY. So, you need to drop the KEY. To drop it into an empty cell (and not into a DOOR cell), you reorient:  \n   \u2022 \"LEFT\" turns you from facing RIGHT to facing UP, and a second \"LEFT\" turns you to face LEFT. Now the cell directly in front of you (from (4,4)) is (4,3), which is free.\n\n11. \"DROP\" places the KEY in cell (4,3).\n\n12\u201313. Now, to exit the left room you need to go back toward the door. At (4,4) you are facing LEFT; you want to face RIGHT (east) so that the door (at (4,5)) is ahead.  \n   \u2022 Two \"LEFT\" turns from facing LEFT will get you around 180\u00b0 (LEFT then LEFT) so that you face RIGHT.\n\n14. \"MOVE\" goes from (4,4) into the door cell at (4,5).\n\n15. \"MOVE\" moves you from (4,5) (the now-unlocked door) into (4,6) in the right room.\n\n16\u201317. Continue in the right room by moving east:  \n   \u2022 Two \"MOVE\" commands take you from (4,6) to (4,7) and then to (4,8).\n\n18. The BOX is located at (1,8). From (4,8), you must head north.  \n   \u2022 \"LEFT\" (from facing RIGHT) turns you to face UP.\n\n19\u201320. Two \"MOVE\" commands take you north: from (4,8) to (3,8) and then to (2,8). Now the BOX in cell (1,8) is directly in front of you.\n\n21. Finally, \"PICKUP\" picks up the BOX.\n\nThis action sequence fulfills your objective of picking up the BOX located in the other room."}
