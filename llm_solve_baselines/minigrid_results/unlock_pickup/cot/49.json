Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nUP\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"DROP\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nLet's explain the plan step\u2010by\u2010step:\n\n1. Starting at (1,4) facing UP, we first turn so that we can head toward the KEY at (4,2). The two \"LEFT\" turns change our direction from UP \u2192 LEFT then LEFT \u2192 DOWN. We then take three \"MOVE\" actions to travel from (1,4) to (4,4).  \n2. We then turn \"RIGHT\" (from DOWN to WEST) so that a \"MOVE\" from (4,4) brings us adjacent to the KEY (KEY is at (4,2), and from (4,3) facing WEST the KEY is in front). We then use \"PICKUP\" to collect the KEY.\n3. With the KEY now in hand, our next goal is to get to the DOOR at (1,5) that connects our room to the box\u2019s room. Starting from (4,3) and facing WEST, we need to reorient to face EAST so we can go back up. Two \"LEFT\" turns (which accomplish a 180\u00b0 turn) make us face EAST. Then a \"MOVE\" takes us to (4,4).  \n4. From (4,4) we turn \"LEFT\" (facing NORTH now) and take three \"MOVE\" actions to climb back up to (1,4). At (1,4) we then turn \"RIGHT\" (to face EAST) so that the cell in front (at (1,5)) is the DOOR. With the KEY held, we perform \"UNLOCK\" to unlock the DOOR.\n5. Because you cannot pick up the BOX while holding something, we must drop the KEY. We turn around 180\u00b0 (two \"LEFT\" turns) to face west, and then \"DROP\" the KEY into an empty adjacent cell at (1,3).\n6. Next, we reorient to face EAST again (another two \"LEFT\" turns) and \"MOVE\" into the now-unlocked DOOR cell (from (1,4) into (1,5)).\n7. Now in the right room, we need to head toward the BOX at (4,7). From (1,5) (facing EAST) we \"MOVE\" twice to reach (1,7). Then a \"RIGHT\" turn makes us face SOUTH. Two \"MOVE\" actions take us from (1,7) down to (3,7). Finally, with the BOX directly in front (at (4,7)), we use \"PICKUP\" to collect it.\n\nThis complete sequence ensures we pick up the BOX (located in the other room) while obeying all movement, pickup, drop, and unlocking rules."}
