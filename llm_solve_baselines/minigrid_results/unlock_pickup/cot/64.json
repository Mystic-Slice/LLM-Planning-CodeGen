Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nLEFT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"DROP\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Starting at (4,4) facing LEFT, we first MOVE left to (4,3).\n2. At (4,3), we need the KEY (located at (3,3)) to be in front of us. Since we\u2019re facing LEFT, we turn RIGHT to face UP.\n3. Now facing UP at (4,3), the cell in front is (3,3) which contains the KEY, so we PICKUP the KEY.\n4. With the key in hand, we MOVE forward from (4,3) to (3,3).\n5. At (3,3), to head toward the door, we TURN RIGHT to face RIGHT.\n6. We then MOVE to (3,4); now the door at (3,5) is directly in front.\n7. With our KEY in hand, we UNLOCK the door in front at (3,5).\n8. Next, we MOVE into the door cell (3,5).\n9-10. To drop the KEY (because we cannot pick up the BOX while holding the KEY), we need an adjacent empty cell. At (3,5) we orient ourselves toward (3,4) by turning RIGHT twice (from facing RIGHT \u2192 DOWN, then DOWN \u2192 LEFT).\n11. Facing left, the cell in front (3,4) is empty, so we DROP the KEY.\n12-13. Now, to pick up the BOX (located at (3,6)), we reorient ourselves by turning RIGHT twice (from facing LEFT \u2192 UP, then UP \u2192 RIGHT).\n14. Finally, facing RIGHT at (3,5), the cell ahead (3,6) has the BOX. We PICKUP the BOX.\n\nThis sequence achieves the goal under the rules provided."}
