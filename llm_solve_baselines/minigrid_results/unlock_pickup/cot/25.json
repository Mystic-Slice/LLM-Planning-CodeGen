Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nRIGHT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nLet's explain the reasoning step by step:\n\n1. Starting at (4,4) facing RIGHT, we first want to get to the KEY at (1,1) which is located in the same room. To go there we must head left. We turn LEFT twice (first LEFT makes us face UP, then another LEFT rotates us to face LEFT) then move three times from (4,4) \u2192 (4,3) \u2192 (4,2) \u2192 (4,1).\n\n2. At (4,1) we need to head upward. A RIGHT turn (from LEFT, a right turn gives UP) aligns us upward. We then MOVE twice: from (4,1) to (3,1) and then from (3,1) to (2,1). This positions us right below the KEY at (1,1), so a subsequent PICKUP (which picks up objects in the cell directly ahead) collects the KEY.\n\n3. With the KEY in hand, we must go to the door at (3,5) (which separates the two rooms) so that we can unlock it. Starting at (2,1) facing UP, we turn RIGHT to face east and then move three times: (2,1) \u2192 (2,2) \u2192 (2,3) \u2192 (2,4). Now at (2,4) still facing RIGHT, we turn RIGHT to face DOWN, and MOVE down from (2,4) to (3,4). At (3,4) we want the door ahead (at (3,5)) so we turn LEFT (from DOWN, LEFT makes us face RIGHT) and then use UNLOCK while facing the door.\n\n4. After unlocking the door, we MOVE into the door cell (3,5). Now inside the other room (the right room) where the BOX is located at (1,6), we need to approach it carefully without stepping onto its cell. From (3,5) still facing RIGHT, we MOVE to (3,6). Then we turn LEFT to face UP and MOVE from (3,6) to (2,6). From (2,6) (still facing UP) we turn RIGHT to face RIGHT and MOV E to (2,7). Next, we turn LEFT (from RIGHT, now facing UP) and MOVE up to (1,7). Finally, a LEFT turn (from UP, turning left faces LEFT) points us so that the cell directly ahead (1,6) is where the BOX sits; a PICKUP then collects the BOX.\n\nThis sequence meets all the rules and objectives."}
