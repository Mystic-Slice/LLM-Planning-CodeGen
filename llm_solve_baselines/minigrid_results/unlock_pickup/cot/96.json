Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nUP\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "Let's break down the puzzle:\n\n1. The KEY is at (row1, col3) and you start at (1,1) facing UP. You can\u2019t directly move into a cell with an object (like the KEY) so you should approach it from an adjacent cell. The plan is to go to (1,2) and, while facing RIGHT (so that (1,3) is in front), use PICKUP.\n\n2. From (1,1) (facing UP), you first turn RIGHT to face EAST, then MOVE from (1,1) to (1,2). Now, with (1,3) in front, you do PICKUP to take the KEY.\n\n3. Once holding the KEY, you must cross to the other room in which the BOX is located. The door is at (4,5), and only its left side (cell (4,4)) is accessible from the room you\u2019re in (the left room). So our goal is to navigate from (1,2) (after picking up the KEY) to (4,4) such that you eventually face the door.\n\n4. From (1,2) (facing RIGHT), MOVE forward to (1,3) (which is now empty) and then to (1,4). Now you need to head downward. Turning RIGHT when facing RIGHT makes you face DOWN.\n\n5. MOVE three times: from (1,4) to (2,4); then to (3,4); then to (4,4). Now you\u2019re at (4,4) but still facing DOWN. To unlock the door that is immediately to your right at (4,5), turn LEFT (from DOWN, LEFT gives you RIGHT).\n\n6. With the KEY in hand and (4,5) directly in front, UNLOCK the door.\n\n7. Now that the door is unlocked (and thus considered empty), MOVE into it and then continue moving RIGHT through the now accessible second room. The BOX is at (4,9) so you need to position yourself at (4,8) facing RIGHT.\n\n8. Continue by moving from (4,4) (after unlocking) step-by-step: MOVE into (4,5) (door cell), then (4,6), (4,7), and finally (4,8). With (4,9) (the BOX) directly in front, perform PICKUP to grab the BOX.\n\nHere is the complete sequence of actions:\n\n<actions>\n[\"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>"}
