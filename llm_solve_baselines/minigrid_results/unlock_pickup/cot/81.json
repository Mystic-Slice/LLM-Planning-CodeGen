Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nRIGHT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"RIGHT\", \"DROP\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the step\u2010by\u2010step reasoning:\n\n1. Starting at (4,2) facing RIGHT, turn LEFT so you face UP.\n2. MOVE from (4,2) to (3,2) (facing UP).\n3. MOVE to (2,2).\n4. MOVE to (1,2). Now you\u2019re in the same room as the KEY.\n5. Turn RIGHT so that you face towards (1,3) where the KEY is.\n6. With the KEY directly in front (at (1,3)), PICKUP the KEY.\n7. MOVE from (1,2) to (1,3).\n8. MOVE to (1,4) so that you\u2019re now adjacent to the DOOR.\n9. Still holding the KEY, face the DOOR (which is at (1,5)) and UNLOCK it.\n10. With the door unlocked but still holding the KEY, turn RIGHT to face DOWN.\n11. DROP the KEY into (2,4) (an empty cell) because you can\u2019t pick up the BOX while carrying another object.\n12. Turn LEFT to reorient from facing DOWN to facing RIGHT.\n13. MOVE from (1,4) to (1,5) \u2013 you are now in the unlocked door cell.\n14. MOVE from (1,5) to (1,6), entering the right room.\n15. Turn RIGHT so that you face DOWN toward the BOX.\n16. Finally, with the BOX at (2,6) directly in front of you, PICKUP the BOX.\n\nThis sequence ensures you pick up the KEY to unlock the door, drop it since you cannot hold two objects, and then navigate to pick up the BOX located in the other room."}
