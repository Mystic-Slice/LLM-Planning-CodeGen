Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nUP\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nLet's explain our reasoning step by step:\n\n1. We start at cell (4,3) facing UP. Our first goal is to get the KEY located at (1,1). Note that because cells with objects cannot be entered, we must stop in an adjacent cell and pick up the object from a neighboring cell.\n2. We choose to head to cell (1,2) so that by turning left we face (1,1) (which contains the KEY) and then use PICKUP.\n3. To do that, from (4,3) we turn LEFT so we are facing LEFT and then MOVE from (4,3) to (4,2).\n4. Now, to move upward, we turn RIGHT (from LEFT, turning right makes us face UP) and MOVE through cells (3,2), (2,2) and then (1,2).\n5. At (1,2) facing UP, we turn LEFT so that we face LEFT toward (1,1) and then PICKUP the KEY.\n6. With the KEY in hand, we now need to unlock the DOOR at (3,5) to access the room where the BOX is. We plan a route from (1,2) to (3,4) (the cell immediately to the left of the door).\n7. From our current position at (1,2) (facing LEFT), we turn LEFT to face DOWN, then MOVE to (2,2) and (3,2).\n8. At (3,2) facing DOWN, we turn LEFT so that we now face RIGHT. Then we MOVE to (3,3) and then to (3,4).\n9. At (3,4) facing RIGHT, the cell in front ((3,5)) holds the DOOR, so we UNLOCK it.\n10. With the door now unlocked (and passable), we MOVE into the door cell (3,5) and then continue moving RIGHT to (3,6) and (3,7).\n11. From (3,7) facing RIGHT, we turn RIGHT to face DOWN. Now the BOX at (4,7) is directly in front of us, so we PICKUP the BOX.\n\nThis sequence of 20 actions will ensure that you pick up the BOX located in the other room."}
