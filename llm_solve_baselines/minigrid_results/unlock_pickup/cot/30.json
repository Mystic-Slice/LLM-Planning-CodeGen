Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"AGENT\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nUP\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"DROP\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nLet's explain step by step:\n\n1. Starting at [1][4] facing UP, we first turn LEFT so that we face the cell [1][3] which contains the KEY.\n2. We then PICKUP the KEY.\n3. Since we still need to unlock the DOOR (at [1][5]), we reorient our agent from facing LEFT to facing RIGHT by issuing two RIGHT turns.\n4. With the KEY in hand and now facing RIGHT, the agent is next to the DOOR. We UNLOCK the DOOR.\n5. We MOVE into the door cell ([1][5]) and then continue moving RIGHT through the open room by executing five consecutive MOVE actions. These moves take us from [1][5] \u2192 [1][6] \u2192 [1][7] \u2192 [1][8] \u2192 [1][9]. (Now the agent is in the box\u2019s room.)\n6. At [1][9] facing RIGHT, we must drop the KEY because we can only hold one object at a time\u2014and we need to pick up the BOX next. We cannot drop it directly in front (because [1][10] is a WALL) so we reorient: two LEFT turns change our facing from RIGHT to WEST so that the cell in front becomes [1][8] (which is empty).\n7. We then DROP the KEY into [1][8].\n8. Next, to access the BOX at [2][9], we need to be facing DOWN. A single LEFT turn from facing WEST rotates us to face DOWN.\n9. Finally, with the BOX in the cell directly in front (i.e. at [2][9]), we execute PICKUP to get the BOX.\n\nThis sequence accomplishes the objective step by step."}
