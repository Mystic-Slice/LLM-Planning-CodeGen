Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nUP\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"RIGHT\", \"DROP\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nLet's explain our reasoning:\n\n1. From the starting position ([1,3] facing UP), we first turn RIGHT twice so that we face DOWN.\n2. We then MOVE three times to go from row 1 \u2192 row 4 (via [2,3] and [3,3]) arriving at cell [4,3].\n3. Facing DOWN at [4,3], we turn RIGHT (which from DOWN makes us face WEST) so that the KEY at [4,1] is in our line of sight.\n4. A MOVE from [4,3] takes us to [4,2], and then with the KEY immediately in front (at [4,1]) we do PICKUP.\n5. Now holding the KEY at [4,2] (facing WEST), we need to reach the door at [1,5]. We turn RIGHT (from WEST, this makes us face NORTH) and then MOVE three times to climb from row 4 up to row 1 (via cells [3,2], [2,2], [1,2]).\n6. At [1,2] facing NORTH, we turn RIGHT to face EAST, and then MOVE twice to arrive at [1,4]. Here the DOOR at [1,5] is directly ahead.\n7. We then UNLOCK the door while holding the KEY.\n8. Since we cannot hold two objects at once and our goal is to pick up the BOX later, we reposition: turning RIGHT (from EAST to SOUTH) so that the adjacent cell [2,4] is empty, and then DROP the KEY there.\n9. To head through the door, we reorient: from [1,4] (now facing SOUTH) we turn LEFT (to face EAST) and MOVE twice\u2014first stepping into the door cell [1,5] (now unlocked) and then into [1,6] in the right room.\n10. Finally, from [1,6] facing EAST, we turn RIGHT so that we face SOUTH. Two consecutive MOVEs take us from [1,6] to [2,6] and then to [3,6]. With the BOX at [4,6] directly ahead, a final PICKUP collects the BOX.\n\nThis sequence of 25 actions completes the objective."}
