Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nRIGHT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Starting at (2,3) facing RIGHT, we first need to grab the KEY located at (2,1). To pick it up, we want to stand at (2,2) and face LEFT (so that the cell ahead, (2,1), contains the KEY). Since we\u2019re facing RIGHT:\n   - \"RIGHT\" \u2192 now facing DOWN.\n   - \"RIGHT\" \u2192 now facing LEFT.\n   - \"MOVE\" \u2192 move one step left from (2,3) to (2,2).\n   - \"PICKUP\" \u2192 pick up the KEY from the cell in front (2,1).\n\n2. With the KEY in hand and now at (2,2) facing LEFT, our next goal is to unlock the door between the rooms. We need to get to (1,4) facing RIGHT so that the door at (1,5) (directly in front) can be unlocked:\n   - \"RIGHT\" \u2192 turn from LEFT to UP.\n   - \"MOVE\" \u2192 move up from (2,2) to (1,2).\n   - \"RIGHT\" \u2192 turn from UP to face RIGHT.\n   - \"MOVE\" \u2192 step right from (1,2) to (1,3).\n   - \"MOVE\" \u2192 step right from (1,3) to (1,4).\n\n3. Now at (1,4) facing RIGHT and with the door immediately in front at (1,5):\n   - \"UNLOCK\" \u2192 unlock the door.\n\n4. Enter the second room:\n   - \"MOVE\" \u2192 move right from (1,4) into the door cell at (1,5).\n\n5. In the second room, the BOX is at (2,7). To pick it up, we position ourselves to the left of the BOX:\n   - \"MOVE\" \u2192 move right from (1,5) to (1,6) (still facing RIGHT).\n   - \"RIGHT\" \u2192 turn right from RIGHT to face DOWN.\n   - \"MOVE\" \u2192 move down from (1,6) to (2,6) (now facing DOWN).\n   - \"LEFT\" \u2192 turn left from DOWN to face RIGHT.\n   - \"PICKUP\" \u2192 pick up the BOX from the cell in front (2,7).\n\nThis sequence fulfills the mission of picking up the BOX located in the other room."}
