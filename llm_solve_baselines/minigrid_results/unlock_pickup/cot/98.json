Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nRIGHT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"DROP\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nStep-by-step explanation:\n\n1. Starting at row4, col2 facing RIGHT, we want to reach the KEY at row3, col1. To leave from col2 to col1 (west), we need to face LEFT. Since our agent is facing RIGHT, we turn LEFT twice:\n   - \"LEFT\" \u2192 now facing UP.\n   - \"LEFT\" \u2192 now facing LEFT.\n2. \"MOVE\": From row4, col2 to row4, col1.\n3. At row4, col1 facing LEFT, the KEY (at row3, col1) is not immediately in front because we need to face UP to have the KEY immediately ahead. So we turn \"RIGHT\" to change orientation from LEFT to UP.\n4. \"PICKUP\": With the agent at row4, col1 facing UP, the cell directly ahead (row3, col1) has the KEY, so we pick it up.\n5. \"MOVE\": Now move upward from row4, col1 to row3, col1 (the cell where the KEY was\u2014but it has now been picked up, so it is empty).\n6. \"MOVE\": Continue moving upward from row3, col1 to row2, col1.\n7. At row2, col1 and still facing UP, we now need to head toward the door. The door is at row2, col5, lying to our right. We turn \"RIGHT\" (from UP, right turn gives RIGHT).\n8. \"MOVE\": Advance from (2,1) to (2,2).\n9. \"MOVE\": Then from (2,2) to (2,3).\n10. \"MOVE\": And from (2,3) to (2,4).\n11. \"UNLOCK\": Facing RIGHT from (2,4), the door at (2,5) is directly ahead. Use the KEY to unlock it.\n12. \"MOVE\": Step into the door (cell (2,5)); now you are in the room that contains the BOX.\n13. At (2,5) facing RIGHT, the BOX is in (2,6) but you are still holding the KEY. Since you cannot hold two objects, you must drop the KEY first.\n    To drop the KEY, find an empty adjacent cell:\n    - Facing RIGHT would place the dropped object in front at (2,6), but that cell contains the BOX.\n    - Therefore, reorient by turning \"RIGHT\" twice so that you face LEFT (with front cell (2,4) which is empty).\n14. \"RIGHT\": Turn from RIGHT to DOWN.\n15. \"RIGHT\": Then turn from DOWN to LEFT.\n16. \"DROP\": Drop the KEY into the empty cell at (2,4).\n17. Now you need to pick up the BOX at (2,6). You are at (2,5) and currently facing LEFT. To face the BOX, turn \"LEFT\" twice:\n    - \"LEFT\": From LEFT to SOUTH.\n    - \"LEFT\": From SOUTH to EAST.\n18. \"PICKUP\": With the agent at (2,5) facing EAST, the cell ahead (2,6) contains the BOX. Pick it up to complete the objective.\n\nThis sequence of steps fulfills the task: switching rooms, obtaining the KEY to unlock the door, and finally picking up the BOX.\n\nHappy gaming!"}
