Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"KEY\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nUP\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nLet's explain the plan step by step:\n\n1. The agent starts at (3,3) facing UP. The KEY lies at (3,4) (to its right). So the agent first turns RIGHT to face east.\n2. With the KEY directly ahead (at (3,4)), the agent executes PICKUP to grab it.\n3. The agent then moves forward into the cell (3,4) formerly occupied by the KEY.\n4. To navigate to the door (located at (4,5)), the agent turns RIGHT (from east, now facing south).\n5. It then moves forward to step into (4,4).\n6. To face the door (which is to the east of (4,4)), the agent turns LEFT (from south to east).\n7. Now the door at (4,5) is directly in front; with the KEY in hand, the agent executes UNLOCK.\n8. With the door unlocked, the agent moves forward into the door cell (4,5).\n9. The agent then moves EAST from (4,5) to (4,6) to enter the room that contains the BOX.\n10. In the new room, to reach the BOX at (1,8), the agent turns LEFT (from east to north).\n11. Then it moves north from (4,6) to (3,6).\n12. Moving north again, it goes from (3,6) to (2,6).\n13. Another MOVE north takes it from (2,6) to (1,6).\n14. Now facing north at (1,6) but needing to approach the BOX from the west, the agent turns RIGHT to face east.\n15. It then moves east into (1,7) so that the BOX in (1,8) is directly ahead.\n16. Finally, with the BOX lined up, the agent executes PICKUP to take the BOX.\n\nThis sequence adheres to all game rules and achieves the objective of picking up the BOX in the other room."}
