Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nUP\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n    [\"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nLet's break down the reasoning step by step:\n\n1. Starting from row2, col1 facing UP, we need to pick up the KEY at row4, col1. Since the KEY is below, we first turn to face DOWN. Two \"RIGHT\" turns will do that.\n\n2. With the agent now facing DOWN, a \"MOVE\" takes you from row2, col1 to row3, col1. Standing at row3, col1 facing DOWN puts row4, col1 (where the KEY is) directly in front. The \"PICKUP\" action collects the KEY.\n\n3. Now that you are holding the KEY, you need it to unlock the door at row2, col5. Return to the door by turning from DOWN to UP (using \"LEFT\" and \"LEFT\") and then \"MOVE\" from row3, col1 to row2, col1.\n\n4. At row2, col1 facing UP, turn \"RIGHT\" to face east (RIGHT) so you can move horizontally toward the door. Three \"MOVE\" actions take you from col1 \u2192 col2, col2 \u2192 col3, and col3 \u2192 col4, positioning you immediately to the left of the door (which occupies row2, col5).\n\n5. Use the \"UNLOCK\" action (while holding the KEY) to open the door.\n\n6. With the door unlocked, \"MOVE\" into the door cell at row2, col5. Continue moving \"MOVE\" twice more to row2, col6 and then row2, col7.\n\n7. At row2, col7 facing RIGHT, turn \"LEFT\" to face UP, aligning you so that the BOX at row1, col7 is directly in front.\n\n8. Use \"PICKUP\" to collect the BOX and complete your objective.\n\nThis sequence of actions successfully navigates through the grid, picks up the KEY, unlocks the door, and then retrieves the BOX from the other room."}
