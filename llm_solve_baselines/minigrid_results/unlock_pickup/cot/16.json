Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nLEFT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"LEFT\", \"DROP\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nLet\u2019s explain the reasoning:\n\n1. Starting at (4,1) facing LEFT, we first turn RIGHT so we face UP.\n2. We MOVE upward twice to go from (4,1) to (3,1) then to (2,1).\n3. Then, to approach the KEY at (2,3) (which we must not enter directly), we turn RIGHT so that from (2,1) we can step to (2,2) with the KEY in the cell immediately to its right.\n4. At (2,2) facing RIGHT, the key is directly in front at (2,3). We issue a PICKUP to grab the KEY.\n5. Now, with KEY in hand, we must unlock the DOOR that leads to the other room. We turn RIGHT (from facing RIGHT to facing DOWN) and MOVE to (3,2).\n6. Next, we turn LEFT so we face RIGHT at (3,2) and then MOVE successively to (3,3) and (3,4). From (3,4) facing RIGHT, the DOOR cell (3,5) is directly ahead.\n7. We then issue UNLOCK (using the KEY) to open the DOOR.\n8. Since we cannot pick up another object while holding the KEY, we must DROP it first. We turn LEFT from RIGHT to face UP so that the cell in front at (2,4) is empty, then DROP the KEY.\n9. With empty hands, we turn RIGHT to face DOOR again and MOVE from (3,4) to (3,5) (through the open door) into the right room.\n10. In the right room, we MOVE rightwards four times to get from (3,5) to (3,8).\n11. To reach the BOX at (2,9), we turn LEFT (so we face UP) and MOVE upward from (3,8) to (2,8).\n12. Turning RIGHT from UP orients us so that the BOX at (2,9) is directly in front. Finally, we issue a PICKUP to pick up the BOX.\n\nThis complete sequence of actions meets the goal."}
