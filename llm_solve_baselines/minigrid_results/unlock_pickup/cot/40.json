Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nLEFT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"RIGHT\", \"DROP\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nLet's explain each step:\n\n1. \"MOVE\": With the agent starting at [4,3] facing LEFT, moving left brings the agent from [4,3] to [4,2].\n2. \"RIGHT\": Turning right changes the facing from LEFT to UP.\n3. \"PICKUP\": Facing UP from [4,2], the cell in front ([3,2]) contains the KEY, so this command picks up the KEY.\n4. \"MOVE\": Move upward from [4,2] into [3,2] (now empty since the KEY has been picked up).\n5. \"RIGHT\": Turn from UP to RIGHT.\n6. \"MOVE\": Move right from [3,2] to [3,3].\n7. \"MOVE\": Move right from [3,3] to [3,4]. Now the agent is adjacent to the door.\n8. \"UNLOCK\": With the KEY in hand at [3,4] facing RIGHT, the door in [3,5] is unlocked.\n9. \"RIGHT\": Turn right from facing RIGHT to face DOWN.\n10. \"DROP\": Dropping the KEY into the cell in front ([4,4]) which is empty.\n11. \"LEFT\": Turning left from DOWN changes the facing to RIGHT, preparing the agent to re-approach the door.\n12. \"MOVE\": Move from [3,4] to [3,5] (the now-unlocked door cell).\n13. \"MOVE\": Move right from [3,5] to [3,6].\n14. \"MOVE\": Move right from [3,6] to [3,7].\n15. \"RIGHT\": With the agent facing RIGHT at [3,7], turning right rotates the facing to DOWN.\n16. \"PICKUP\": Facing DOWN from [3,7], the box in [4,7] is directly in front, so this command picks up the BOX.\n\nThis sequence guides the agent step by step to obtain the box located in the other room."}
