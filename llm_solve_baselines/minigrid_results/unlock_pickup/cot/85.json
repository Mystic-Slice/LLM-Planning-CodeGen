Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nUP\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"DROP\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nLet's explain the plan step by step:\n\n1. Starting at (4,1) facing UP, the KEY is located at (2,1). First, the agent moves one cell north to (3,1). Now, with the agent still facing UP, the cell in front, (2,1), contains the KEY.  \n   \u2022 Action: \"MOVE\"\n\n2. The agent then executes \"PICKUP\" to collect the KEY from (2,1).  \n   \u2022 Action: \"PICKUP\"\n\n3. Now holding the KEY and at (3,1) facing UP, the agent needs to head toward the door at (3,5) (which lies in the east direction). So the agent turns right (now facing EAST).  \n   \u2022 Action: \"RIGHT\"\n\n4. The agent moves eastward three times to progress from (3,1) \u2192 (3,2) \u2192 (3,3) \u2192 (3,4).  \n   \u2022 Actions: \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"\n\n5. At (3,4) facing EAST, the cell ahead (3,5) is the locked DOOR. With the KEY in hand, the agent uses \"UNLOCK\" to open the door.  \n   \u2022 Action: \"UNLOCK\"\n\n6. The agent moves into the door cell (3,5), continuing eastward through the now-unlocked doorway. Then proceeds further eastward to reach (3,6), (3,7), and (3,8).  \n   \u2022 Actions: \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\"\n\n7. The BOX is located at (1,8) in the opposite room. From (3,8) facing EAST, the agent turns left to face NORTH.  \n   \u2022 Action: \"LEFT\"\n\n8. Moving north from (3,8) lands the agent at (2,8) still facing NORTH.  \n   \u2022 Action: \"MOVE\"\n\n9. Since the agent is still holding the KEY and cannot pick up the BOX while holding another object, and (1,8) (in front if still facing north) has the BOX, the agent needs to drop the KEY first. An adjacent empty cell is (2,7). To drop there, the agent turns left (from NORTH to WEST).  \n   \u2022 Action: \"LEFT\"\n\n10. With the agent now facing WEST and (2,7) empty, \"DROP\" places the KEY into that cell.  \n    \u2022 Action: \"DROP\"\n\n11. The agent then turns right (from WEST back to NORTH) so the BOX at (1,8) is directly in front again.  \n    \u2022 Action: \"RIGHT\"\n\n12. Finally, \"PICKUP\" is executed to grab the BOX from (1,8).  \n    \u2022 Action: \"PICKUP\"\n\nThis sequence of actions moves the agent from its starting position, collects the KEY in its room, approaches and unlocks the door to the adjacent room, disposes of the KEY appropriately (to free up the capacity) and finally picks up the BOX located in the other room."}
