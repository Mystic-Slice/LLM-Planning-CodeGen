Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nUP\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n    [\"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"DROP\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nLet's explain step by step:\n\n1. Start at (2,3) facing UP.  \n   \u2022 \"RIGHT\" \u2192 now facing RIGHT.\n2. \"MOVE\" \u2192 moves to (2,4) facing RIGHT.\n3. \"RIGHT\" \u2192 now facing DOWN.\n4. \"PICKUP\" \u2192 with (3,4) (directly below) containing the KEY, you pick it up.  \n   (You remain at (2,4) holding the KEY.)\n5\u20136. You need to get to (1,4) (above) so that the door can later be unlocked. Since you\u2019re facing DOWN, you make two left turns:  \n   \u2022 \"LEFT\" (facing RIGHT), then \"LEFT\" (facing UP).\n7. \"MOVE\" \u2192 from (2,4) to (1,4) facing UP.\n8. \"RIGHT\" \u2192 now facing RIGHT so that (1,5) (the DOOR cell) is in front.\n9. \"UNLOCK\" \u2192 using the KEY to unlock the door at (1,5).\n10\u201311. To free your hands so you can later pick up the BOX, you need to drop the KEY in an empty cell. You choose (1,3) by reorienting:  \n    \u2022 \"LEFT\" turns from RIGHT to UP, then \"LEFT\" turns from UP to LEFT.\n12. \"DROP\" \u2192 drops the KEY into the empty cell (1,3).\n13\u201314. Now, reorient from facing LEFT to facing RIGHT (needed to head through the door). Two \"RIGHT\" actions:  \n    \u2022 \"RIGHT\" (from LEFT becomes UP), \"RIGHT\" (from UP becomes RIGHT).\n15. \"MOVE\" \u2192 from (1,4) to (1,5) (the unlocked door cell), entering the other room.\n16\u201317. \"MOVE\" twice \u2192 progress rightward: from (1,5) to (1,6) and then to (1,7).\n18. \"PICKUP\" \u2192 from (1,7) facing RIGHT, the cell (1,8) contains the BOX, so you pick it up.\n\nThis sequence successfully moves you from your starting room to the other room, unlocks the door using the KEY, drops the KEY (making room in your hands), and finally picks up the BOX."}
