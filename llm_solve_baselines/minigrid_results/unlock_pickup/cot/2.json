Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nLEFT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. The agent starts at [1,1] facing LEFT. Since the key is in room on the lower part (at [4,3]), the agent first needs to head downward. With the agent facing LEFT, executing a \"LEFT\" turn changes its direction to DOWN.\n2. Three \"MOVE\" actions take the agent from [1,1] to [2,1], then to [3,1] and finally to [4,1].\n3. From [4,1] facing DOWN, a \"LEFT\" turn makes the agent face RIGHT (since from DOWN, turning left points east).\n4. A \"MOVE\" from [4,1] puts the agent at [4,2]. Now, with the agent at [4,2] facing RIGHT, the cell directly ahead ([4,3]) contains the KEY. The agent uses \"PICKUP\" to acquire it.\n5. With the key in hand, the agent now needs to unlock the door that stands between the two rooms. The door is at [4,5]. The agent first moves (with \"MOVE\") from [4,2] to [4,3] (the cell where the key was, which is now empty) and then another \"MOVE\" to reach [4,4]. Now, facing RIGHT, the door at [4,5] is directly ahead.\n6. The agent executes \"UNLOCK\" (using the KEY in hand) to open the door.\n7. After unlocking, two \"MOVE\" actions take the agent first into the now-open door cell at [4,5] and then to [4,6].\n8. With the agent at [4,6] facing RIGHT, the BOX is located in the cell directly ahead ([4,7]). The final action is \"PICKUP\" to collect the BOX.\n\nThis sequence of actions fulfills the objective of picking up the BOX from the other room."}
