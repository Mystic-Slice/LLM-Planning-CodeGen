Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nRIGHT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n    [\"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"LEFT\", \"DROP\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the step\u2010by\u2010step reasoning:\n\n1. Starting at (1,2) facing RIGHT, turn RIGHT so you face DOWN.\n2. MOVE from (1,2) to (2,2) (facing DOWN). Now the cell in front (3,2) contains the KEY.\n3. Execute PICKUP while facing DOWN to pick up the KEY from (3,2).\n4. MOVE from (2,2) to (3,2) (still facing DOWN).\n5. MOVE from (3,2) to (4,2) (facing DOWN).\n6. At (4,2), turn LEFT to face RIGHT.\n7. MOVE from (4,2) to (4,3) (facing RIGHT).\n8. MOVE from (4,3) to (4,4) (facing RIGHT). Now you are adjacent to the door at (4,5).\n9. With the KEY in hand and the door immediately in front, UNLOCK the door.\n10. Still at (4,4) but facing RIGHT, you cannot drop the KEY into the door cell. So, turn LEFT to face UP (an adjacent empty cell, (3,4)).\n11. DROP the KEY into (3,4) so that your hands are free to pick up the BOX later.\n12. To cross into the other room, turn RIGHT from UP (now facing RIGHT) to align with the door.\n13. MOVE from (4,4) to (4,5) (entering the former door cell, now empty).\n14. MOVE from (4,5) to (4,6) in the right room.\n15. Turn LEFT so that you face UP.\n16. MOVE from (4,6) to (3,6) (facing UP).\n17. MOVE from (3,6) to (2,6) (facing UP). Now you are adjacent to the BOX at (1,6).\n18. Finally, execute PICKUP to grab the BOX.\n\nThis sequence satisfies the rules and gets you to pick up the BOX in the other room."}
