Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nLEFT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n    [\"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"DROP\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nWe can explain the plan step\u2010by\u2010step:\n\n1. Starting at (4,4) facing LEFT, the agent moves two steps left to (4,2) (\u201cMOVE\u201d, \u201cMOVE\u201d).\n2. Then it turns RIGHT (from LEFT, \u201cRIGHT\u201d makes the agent face UP) and moves upward (\u201cMOVE\u201d) to (3,2). Now, facing UP, the cell in front \u2013 (2,2) \u2013 contains the KEY, so the agent \u201cPICKUP\u201ds it.\n3. With the KEY in hand, the agent must now unlock the door at (3,5) to enter the other room. From (3,2) the agent turns \u201cRIGHT\u201d (now facing RIGHT) and moves twice \u201cMOVE\u201d, \u201cMOVE\u201d to reach (3,4), which is immediately to the left of the door.\n4. The agent \u201cUNLOCK\u201ds the door at (3,5) and then \u201cMOVE\u201ds into the door cell.\n5. Now inside the box\u2019s room, the agent navigates from (3,5) by moving right four times (\u201cMOVE\u201d, \u201cMOVE\u201d, \u201cMOVE\u201d, \u201cMOVE\u201d) to arrive at (3,8). Then it turns \u201cLEFT\u201d to face UP and moves upward twice (\u201cMOVE\u201d, \u201cMOVE\u201d) to reach (1,8), which is adjacent to the BOX at (1,9).\n6. Because the agent cannot pick up the BOX while still holding the KEY, it needs to drop the KEY in an empty adjacent cell. From (1,8) (after turning \u201cRIGHT\u201d so its initial heading becomes RIGHT), it turns twice (\u201cLEFT\u201d, \u201cLEFT\u201d) to face LEFT so that the empty cell (1,7) is in front, then \u201cDROP\u201ds the KEY.\n7. Finally, the agent reorients by turning twice (\u201cLEFT\u201d, \u201cLEFT\u201d) to face RIGHT (facing the BOX) and \u201cPICKUP\u201ds the BOX at (1,9).\n\nThis complete action list satisfies the objective."}
