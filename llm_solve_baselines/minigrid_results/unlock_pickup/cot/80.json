Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nLEFT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n1. The agent starts at [1][4] facing LEFT. To head toward the KEY at [4][3] (which is in the left room), the agent first turns left. Facing LEFT, a \"LEFT\" turn makes the agent face DOWN.\n2. With the agent now facing DOWN at [1][4], three consecutive \"MOVE\" actions will take the agent to [2][4], then [3][4], and finally [4][4].\n3. At [4][4], the KEY is located one cell to the left at [4][3]. To face that direction:\n   - While facing DOWN, a \"RIGHT\" turn changes the facing from DOWN to LEFT.\n4. With the agent at [4][4] now facing LEFT (so that [4][3] is in front), the \"PICKUP\" action collects the KEY.\n5. Next, with the KEY in hand, the agent must unlock the door at [4][5] to access the other room. The door is to the right of the agent\u2019s current cell. Since the agent is facing LEFT, two turns are needed:\n   - A \"RIGHT\" turn (from LEFT to UP) and then another \"RIGHT\" turn (from UP to RIGHT) make the agent face RIGHT.\n6. Facing RIGHT, the \"UNLOCK\" action unlocks the door at [4][5].\n7. The agent then \"MOVE\"s into the door cell at [4][5].\n8. In the right room, the BOX is at [3][6]. From [4][5] facing RIGHT, a \"MOVE\" takes the agent to [4][6].\n9. To have the BOX directly in front, the agent must face UP. A \"LEFT\" turn from RIGHT makes the agent face UP.\n10. Finally, the \"PICKUP\" action picks up the BOX (located at [3][6] directly ahead).\n\nThis sequence completes the objective step by step."}
