Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nDOWN\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"DROP\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The agent starts at [4][4] facing DOWN. We first need to reach the KEY at [2][2] (which is in the left room).  \n   \u2022 From DOWN, a RIGHT turn makes the agent face WEST.  \n   \u2022 A MOVE takes the agent from [4][4] to [4][3].\n\n2. Now from [4][3] still facing WEST, a RIGHT turn makes the agent face NORTH.  \n   \u2022 A MOVE takes the agent from [4][3] to [3][3].  \n   \u2022 Another MOVE takes the agent from [3][3] to [2][3].\n\n3. At [2][3] facing NORTH, a LEFT turn makes the agent face WEST so the KEY cell ([2][2]) is directly in front.  \n   \u2022 A PICKUP collects the KEY.\n\n4. With the KEY in hand at [2][3] and facing WEST, we need to unlock the DOOR at [2][5] (located in the wall between the two rooms).  \n   \u2022 Two RIGHT turns (from WEST to NORTH, then NORTH to EAST) orient the agent to face EAST.  \n   \u2022 A MOVE goes from [2][3] to [2][4] where the door\u2019s adjacent cell is in front.  \n   \u2022 An UNLOCK action uses the KEY (which must be held) to unlock the DOOR that is directly ahead ([2][5]). \n\n5. Having unlocked the door, the agent now proceeds into the right room where the BOX is located at [1][7].  \n   \u2022 A MOVE takes the agent from [2][4] to [2][5] (the door cell, now open).  \n   \u2022 Another MOVE goes from [2][5] to [2][6].  \n\n6. Since the agent cannot pick up the BOX while holding the KEY, the KEY must be dropped in a valid empty adjacent cell.  \n   \u2022 With the agent at [2][6] facing EAST, the cell directly in front ([2][7]) is empty, so a DROP action places the KEY there.\n\n7. Now free-handed, the agent navigates to pick up the BOX.  \n   \u2022 A LEFT turn from EAST makes the agent face NORTH.  \n   \u2022 A MOVE from [2][6] goes to [1][6].  \n   \u2022 A RIGHT turn from NORTH reorients the agent to EAST, so that the BOX at [1][7] is directly ahead.  \n   \u2022 Finally, a PICKUP collects the BOX from [1][7].\n\nThis sequence of 18 actions satisfies the objective: retrieve the BOX located in the other room."}
