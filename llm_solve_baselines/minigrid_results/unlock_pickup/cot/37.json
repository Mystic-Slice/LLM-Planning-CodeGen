Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nRIGHT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n    [\"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"DROP\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the step\u2010by\u2010step reasoning:\n\n1. Starting at (2,1) facing RIGHT, we first need the KEY located at (3,1) (directly below). Since the KEY must be in the adjacent cell in front for a PICKUP action, we turn RIGHT so that we\u2019re facing DOWN.\n2. With (3,1) now in front, we use PICKUP to grab the KEY.\n3. Now holding the KEY at (2,1) (facing down), we must go to the door to unlock it. The door is at (1,5) while we want to stand at (1,4) facing east. So first we reorient from DOWN to UP by executing TWO LEFT turns.\n4. We then MOVE north from (2,1) to (1,1).\n5. Now facing UP at (1,1), we turn RIGHT to face EAST so we can move along row 1.\n6. We MOVE three times: (1,1) \u2192 (1,2), (1,2) \u2192 (1,3), and (1,3) \u2192 (1,4).\n7. Standing at (1,4) and facing EAST, the door at (1,5) is directly ahead. We execute UNLOCK (using the held KEY).\n8. After unlocking, since we can\u2019t hold both key and box, we need to drop the KEY. However, we cannot drop it into the door cell. So, from (1,4) facing east, we turn RIGHT to face SOUTH and MOVE to (2,4). From (2,4) (facing south), the cell in front is (3,4) \u2013 an empty valid cell \u2013 so we DROP the KEY there.\n9. Now, empty-handed, we need to approach the BOX. The BOX is in the adjacent room at (1,6). To pick it up, we need to be just to its left. We reorient from (2,4) facing SOUTH to face NORTH (by doing two LEFT turns) and then MOVE north to (1,4).\n10. At (1,4) facing NORTH, we turn RIGHT to face EAST. We then MOVE into the door cell at (1,5). Now with the BOX (at (1,6)) directly ahead, we PICKUP the BOX.\n\nThis complete sequence of actions fulfills the objective."}
