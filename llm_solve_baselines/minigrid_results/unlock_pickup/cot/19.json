Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nUP\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"DROP\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nLet's explain the plan step by step:\n\n1. Starting at (2,1) facing UP, turn RIGHT to face towards the KEY.\n2.\u20134. MOVE three times to go from (2,1) \u2192 (2,2) \u2192 (2,3) \u2192 (2,4). Now you\u2019re in front of the cell below the KEY.\n5. Turn LEFT so you face UP. The KEY is directly ahead at (1,4).\n6. PICKUP the KEY.\n7.\u20138. Turn LEFT twice (from UP to LEFT then to DOWN) so you can position yourself behind the door.  \n9. MOVE from (2,4) to (3,4). Now you\u2019re adjacent to the DOOR location.\n10. Turn LEFT to face RIGHT so that the door at (3,5) is directly in front.\n11. Use UNLOCK to open the door (with your KEY in hand).\n12.\u201313. To drop the KEY (since you can\u2019t hold it when picking up the BOX), turn RIGHT twice (rotating through DOWN to LEFT) so that you face an empty cell in the left room.\n14. DROP the KEY into (3,3), which is empty.\n15.\u201316. Turn LEFT twice to rotate 180\u00b0 from facing LEFT back to facing RIGHT.\n17. MOVE from (3,4) to (3,5) entering the unlocked door cell.\n18. MOVE from (3,5) to (3,6) into the right-hand room.\n19. Turn LEFT to face UP.\n20.\u201321. MOVE upward from (3,6) to (2,6) to (1,6).\n22. Turn RIGHT from UP so you now face RIGHT.\n23. Finally, PICKUP the BOX (located at (1,7)).\n\nThis sequence satisfies the rules and completes the objective."}
