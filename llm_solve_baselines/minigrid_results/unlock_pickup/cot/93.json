Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nUP\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"DROP\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nLet's explain the reasoning step by step:\n\n1. Starting at (1,4) facing UP, the KEY is at (2,2) in the left-room. We first need to grab the KEY so you can later unlock the door.\n   - Action1: \"LEFT\" turns you from UP to LEFT.\n   - Action2: \"MOVE\" moves you to (1,3).\n   - Action3: \"MOVE\" moves you to (1,2).\n   - Action4: \"LEFT\" now turns you from LEFT to DOWN, so the cell in front is (2,2) where the KEY is.\n   - Action5: \"PICKUP\" picks up the KEY (remember, you do not move into the KEY\u2019s cell\u2014you remain at (1,2) with the KEY in hand).\n\n2. Now holding the KEY, you need to head to the door (the connection between the two rooms). The door is at (4,5) and can be unlocked only while holding the KEY. You plan to approach it from the left room by standing at (4,4) with a view to the right.\n   - Action6: \"MOVE\" from (1,2) down to (2,2) (now that cell is empty since the KEY was picked up).\n   - Action7: \"MOVE\" takes you further down to (3,2).\n   - Action8: \"LEFT\" changes direction from DOWN to RIGHT.\n   - Action9: \"MOVE\" moves you from (3,2) to (3,3).\n   - Action10: \"MOVE\" moves you from (3,3) to (3,4).\n   - Action11: \"RIGHT\" rotates you from RIGHT to DOWN.\n   - Action12: \"MOVE\" takes you down to (4,4).\n\n3. At (4,4) you need to face the door at (4,5) so you can unlock it.\n   - Action13: \"LEFT\" rotates you from DOWN to RIGHT.\n   - Action14: \"UNLOCK\" unlocks the door in front (cell (4,5)) with your KEY.\n\n4. You\u2019re still holding the KEY, but since you can only carry one object at a time and your objective is to pick up the BOX, you must drop the KEY. However, you cannot drop into a door cell. So, reposition to drop into an adjacent empty cell.\n   - At (4,4) facing RIGHT, you want to drop into the left cell (4,3). To do this, you change orientation:\n   - Action15: \"LEFT\" turns you from RIGHT to UP.\n   - Action16: \"LEFT\" turns you from UP to LEFT.\n   - Action17: \"DROP\" drops the KEY into (4,3).\n\n5. Now that your hands are free, reorient yourself to cross the door. The door cell (4,5) is to your right.\n   - From your current orientation (LEFT), turn 180\u00b0:\n   - Action18: \"LEFT\" rotates you from LEFT to DOWN.\n   - Action19: \"LEFT\" rotates you from DOWN to RIGHT.\n   - Action20: \"MOVE\" moves you from (4,4) into the door cell (4,5). \n   - Action21: \"MOVE\" further moves you from (4,5) to (4,6) into the right room.\n\n6. In the right room the BOX is at (2,6). To pick it up without moving into its cell, you plan to stand in (3,6) facing UP so that the cell directly ahead (2,6) holds the BOX.\n   - Action22: \"LEFT\" turns you from RIGHT to UP.\n   - Action23: \"MOVE\" takes you from (4,6) up to (3,6).\n   - Action24: \"PICKUP\" picks up the BOX from (2,6).\n\nFollowing these 24 actions completes your objective."}
