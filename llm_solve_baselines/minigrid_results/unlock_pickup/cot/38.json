Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nDOWN\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"DROP\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. The KEY is in cell (2,4) and the AGENT starts at (4,2) facing DOWN. The first goal is to pick up the key in your room.\n   \u2022 From (4,2) facing DOWN, two \"LEFT\" turns reorient you to face UP.\n   \u2022 \"MOVE\" brings you to (3,2).\n   \u2022 A \"RIGHT\" turn changes your direction to RIGHT so that you can head east.\n   \u2022 \"MOVE\" to (3,3), then a \"LEFT\" turn reorients you UP.\n   \u2022 \"MOVE\" takes you to (2,3) and then a \"RIGHT\" turn points you to the KEY at (2,4).\n   \u2022 \"PICKUP\" collects the KEY.\n\n2. Next, you need to unlock the door (at cell (1,5)) to get into the room with the BOX (located at (1,6)). You must be adjacent to the door and facing it.\n   \u2022 \"MOVE\" from (2,3) (while holding the KEY) takes you into (2,4).\n   \u2022 \"LEFT\" turns you to face UP.\n   \u2022 \"MOVE\" to (1,4) and a \"RIGHT\" turn then position you so the door (at (1,5)) is directly in front.\n   \u2022 \"UNLOCK\" then opens the door.\n\n3. Because you must not hold two objects at the same time and you want to pick up the BOX later, you now drop the KEY into a nearby empty cell.\n   \u2022 To drop, first reorient from facing RIGHT (current direction at (1,4)) by turning \"LEFT\" twice (from RIGHT \u2192 UP then UP \u2192 LEFT) so that you face the empty cell (1,3).\n   \u2022 \"DROP\" releases the KEY at (1,3).\n\n4. Finally, reorient yourself to face RIGHT (the door direction) by turning \"LEFT\" twice (from LEFT \u2192 SOUTH then South \u2192 EAST).\n   \u2022 \"MOVE\" from (1,4) takes you into the unlocked door cell (1,5).\n   \u2022 Now standing at (1,5) and facing RIGHT, \"PICKUP\" picks up the BOX in cell (1,6).\n\nThis 21\u2010step plan fulfills your objective."}
