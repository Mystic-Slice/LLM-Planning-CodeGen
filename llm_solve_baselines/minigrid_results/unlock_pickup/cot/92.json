Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nDOWN\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nHere's the step\u2010by\u2010step reasoning:\n\n1. Starting at (4,1) facing DOWN, we need to get the KEY located at (3,2). To face UP (so we can approach the key\u2019s cell from the left), we turn \"LEFT\" then \"LEFT\" (DOWN \u2192 RIGHT \u2192 UP).  \n2. \"MOVE\" brings us into (3,1) facing UP.  \n3. Then \"RIGHT\" turns our orientation to EAST so that the cell (3,2) containing the KEY is directly in front.  \n4. \"PICKUP\" collects the KEY from (3,2).  \n5. With the KEY in hand, we must unlock the door that separates the rooms. We plan a route to approach the door at (2,5) from its left side.  \n6. \"MOVE\" three times (eastward) takes us from (3,1) \u2192 (3,2) \u2192 (3,3) \u2192 (3,4).  \n7. \"LEFT\" changes our direction from EAST to NORTH.  \n8. \"MOVE\" advances us from (3,4) to (2,4), which is immediately left of the door.  \n9. \"RIGHT\" rotates our orientation to EAST so that the door at (2,5) is in front.  \n10. \"UNLOCK\" unlocks the door using the KEY.  \n11. Now, with the door unlocked, \"MOVE\" takes us into the door cell at (2,5), and another \"MOVE\" brings us to (2,6).  \n12. Facing EAST, \"PICKUP\" collects the BOX located in the cell (2,7).\n\nThis sequence successfully enables the agent to pick up the BOX located in the other room."}
