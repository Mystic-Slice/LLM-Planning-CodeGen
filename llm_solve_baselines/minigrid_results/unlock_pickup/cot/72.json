Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nLEFT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"DROP\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nWe can explain the plan step\u2010by\u2010step:\n\n1. Starting at (2,1) facing LEFT, we first turn LEFT so we face DOWN.\n2. MOVE from (2,1) to (3,1).\n3. Turn LEFT from DOWN to face RIGHT.\n4\u20135. MOVE twice to advance from (3,1) to (3,2) then (3,3). Now the KEY is located in the cell (3,4) immediately to our RIGHT.\n6. PICKUP the KEY from (3,4) (since it\u2019s directly ahead from (3,3)).\n7. MOVE into (3,4) (now empty after you pick up the KEY).\n8\u201310. Turn RIGHT (from RIGHT to DOWN) and MOVE: By turning RIGHT you face DOWN, then MOVE from (3,4) to (4,4). Then turn LEFT so that you face RIGHT; the DOOR (at (4,5)) is now directly in front.\n11. UNLOCK the DOOR using the KEY.\n12\u201313. MOVE first into the DOOR\u2019s cell (4,5), then further right into (4,6). You are now in the adjacent room (the target room with the BOX).\n14\u201317. Turn LEFT to face UP and MOVE three times: from (4,6) up to (3,6), then to (2,6), and finally to (1,6). You are now in position to retrieve the BOX, which is at (1,7); however, you\u2019re still holding the KEY.\n18\u201319. Since you cannot pick up the BOX while holding an object, turn RIGHT twice from UP to face DOWN. (We choose DOWN because the cell beneath (1,6), i.e. (2,6), is empty.)\n20. DROP the KEY into (2,6).\n21. Turn LEFT from DOWN so that you face RIGHT.\n22. Finally, with your hands now free and facing the BOX at (1,7), PICKUP the BOX.\n\nThis sequence obeys all movement and action rules and completes the objective."}
