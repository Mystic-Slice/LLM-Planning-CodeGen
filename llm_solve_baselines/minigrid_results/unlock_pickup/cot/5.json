Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nRIGHT\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "We can solve the puzzle in two main phases. In Phase\u202f1 the agent picks up the KEY in its room and then uses it to unlock the door. In Phase\u202f2 the agent drops the KEY (since you cannot pick up a second object while holding one) and then enters the other room to pick up the BOX.\n\nLet\u2019s walk through a possible solution step by step. (Coordinates are given as [row, col] with row index increasing downward.) Initially, the agent is at [4,3] facing RIGHT. The KEY is at [3,2] and the door is at [3,5] (separating the left \u201cagent\u201d room from the right \u201cBOX\u201d room). The BOX is later found at [1,8] in the other room.\n\nPhase 1: Get the KEY and unlock the door\n1. The agent turns LEFT so that, from facing RIGHT, it now faces UP.\n2. It then MOVEs forward from [4,3] to [3,3].\n3. Next, it turns LEFT again. (Now from UP it faces LEFT.)\n4. It MOVEs from [3,3] to [3,2] where the KEY is.\n5. With the KEY immediately in front, the agent PICKUPs it.\n\nAt this point the agent is at [3,2] holding the KEY and facing LEFT. To head toward the door (at [3,5], to its east) the agent must reorient:\n6. A LEFT turn makes the agent face SOUTH.\n7. Another LEFT turn makes it face EAST.\n8. Then a MOVE takes the agent from [3,2] to [3,3].\n9. Another MOVE puts the agent at [3,4]. (Note: the door is at [3,5] \u2013 directly in front of [3,4].)\n10. Now, while still holding the KEY, the agent executes UNLOCK to unlock the door in the cell immediately in front ([3,5]).\n11. With the door unlocked, a MOVE brings the agent into the door cell at [3,5] (entering the other room) while still holding the KEY.\n\nPhase 2: Drop the KEY and pick up the BOX  \nBecause you cannot PICKUP the BOX while already holding an object, you must DROP the KEY first. However, you must drop it into an empty adjacent cell. In the new room (at [3,5]) if you simply drop it \u201cforward\u201d (i.e. to the east) you would block your planned route. Instead, do this:\n\n12. Turn LEFT (from EAST to NORTH).\n13. Turn LEFT again (from NORTH to WEST).  \n   Now facing WEST, the cell immediately ahead is [3,4] \u2013 which (in our grid) is an empty cell.\n14. Execute DROP to leave the KEY at [3,4]. (It doesn\u2019t matter that the KEY is now in the agent\u2019s former room; it is no longer held.)\n15. Reorient to continue toward the BOX: turn RIGHT (from WEST to NORTH).\n16. Turn RIGHT again (from NORTH to EAST) so the agent faces toward the new room\u2019s east side.\n\nNow plan a route to the BOX. The BOX is in the upper part of the new room (at [1,8]). A viable route is to first go east, then north, then east again so that the BOX is directly in front when you stand at [1,7].\n17. MOVE from [3,5] to [3,6] (facing EAST).\n18. Turn LEFT so the agent now faces NORTH.\n19. MOVE from [3,6] to [2,6].\n20. MOVE from [2,6] to [1,6].\n21. Turn RIGHT so that from NORTH the agent now faces EAST.\n22. MOVE from [1,6] to [1,7].\n23. Finally, with the BOX now directly in front (at [1,8]), execute PICKUP to grab the BOX.\n\nThe full list of actions is provided below wrapped in the required XML tags.\n\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"UNLOCK\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"DROP\", \"RIGHT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>"}
