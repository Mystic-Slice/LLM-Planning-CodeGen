Your objective is to pick up a `BOX` that is located in a different room than your starting position.\n\n### Environment Description:\n- The grid is represented as a 2D array, with the top-left corner at `[0][0]`. Each cell can contain one of the following objects:\n  - `WALL`, `DOOR`, `KEY`, `BOX`, `AGENT` (You), or an empty string (`\"\"`).\n- You start in a specific cell facing one of four directions: `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, or `RIGHT` (this will be provided).\n- Two rooms are separated by `WALL`s, with a single `DOOR` connecting them.\n\n### Actions:\nYou can perform the following actions:\n- `LEFT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the left.\n- `RIGHT`: Turn 90\u00b0 to the right.\n- `MOVE`: Move one step forward in the direction you're facing.\n- `PICKUP`: Pick up an object located in the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `DROP`: Drop the object you're holding into the cell *directly in front* of you.\n- `UNLOCK`: Unlock the door located *directly in front* of you, if you are holding the `KEY`.\n\n### Rules:\n- You may only hold **one object at a time** (`KEY` or `BOX`).\n- Before picking up a new object, you must `DROP` the one you\u2019re holding into an **empty adjacent cell** (no `WALL`, `DOOR`, or object).\n- You can only `PICKUP` or `UNLOCK` if:\n  - The target cell is directly in front of you (i.e., one step in the direction you're facing).\n  - You are adjacent to that cell.\n- You cannot:\n  - Enter a cell that contains any object unless it\u2019s been picked up or is a now-empty `DOOR` cell.\n  - Drop objects into non-empty cells or into a `WALL` or `DOOR` cell.\n  - Pick up an object (e.g. `BOX`) when you are already holding one (e.g. `KEY`).\n\n### Input:\nYou will be provided:\n- The complete 2D grid as a list of lists (example below).\n- Your starting facing direction.\n\n### Output:\nYour output should be a list of actions in the following format:\n<actions>\n    [\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", ...]\n</actions>\nMake sure to use <actions> and </actions> XML tags for your output.\n\nBelow is a sample input grid and starting direction.\n\n<grid>\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"KEY\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"AGENT\", \"\", \"WALL\", \"BOX\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"DOOR\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"WALL\"]\n[\"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\", \"WALL\"]\n</grid>\n<start_direction>\nDOWN\n</start_direction>\n\nLet's think step by step.", "response": "<actions>\n[\"LEFT\", \"LEFT\", \"MOVE\", \"PICKUP\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"UNLOCK\", \"LEFT\", \"DROP\", \"RIGHT\", \"MOVE\", \"MOVE\", \"LEFT\", \"PICKUP\"]\n</actions>\n\nLet\u2019s explain the reasoning step by step:\n\n1. We start at row3 col3 facing DOWN. Since the key lies at row1 col3, we first turn 180\u00b0 (with two LEFT turns) so that we face UP.\n   - Actions: \"LEFT\", \"LEFT\".\n\n2. Now from row3 col3 facing UP, we move one cell forward to row2 col3.\n   - Action: \"MOVE\".\n\n3. With the agent at row2 col3 and still facing UP, the cell directly ahead (row1 col3) holds the KEY. Use \"PICKUP\" to grab the KEY.\n   - Action: \"PICKUP\".\n\n4. With the KEY in hand, we need to unlock a door that separates our room from the BOX room. The door is at row4 col5. To reach a cell adjacent to the door:\n   - Turn right (from facing UP to face EAST) so that we can move toward the open area.\n     - Action: \"RIGHT\".\n   - Move East from row2 col3 to row2 col4.\n     - Action: \"MOVE\".\n   - Turn right to face SOUTH, because our target (row4 col4) is further down.\n     - Action: \"RIGHT\".\n   - Move SOUTH from row2 col4 to row3 col4.\n     - Action: \"MOVE\".\n   - Move SOUTH again from row3 col4 to row4 col4.\n     - Action: \"MOVE\".\n\n5. Now the agent is at row4 col4 facing SOUTH and is adjacent (to the East) to the DOOR (row4 col5). The agent needs to face EAST:\n   - Turn LEFT (from SOUTH to EAST).\n     - Action: \"LEFT\".\n   - Use \"UNLOCK\" while facing the door to open it (the door is unlocked but still considered a door cell, so dropping is not allowed there).\n     - Action: \"UNLOCK\".\n\n6. Since we are still holding the KEY and the rules only allow one object at a time, we must drop the KEY into an empty adjacent cell before picking up the BOX later. Here, from row4 col4 while facing EAST, we want to drop the key into a safe cell. We opt to drop it by turning to face NORTH (so that the drop happens into row3 col4, which is empty).\n   - Turn LEFT from EAST to face NORTH.\n     - Action: \"LEFT\".\n   - Drop the KEY.\n     - Action: \"DROP\".\n\n7. Next, we need to move into the next room to get the BOX which resides at row3 col6 (in the right room). From our current position (row4 col4 facing NORTH), we plan to cross through the unlocked door:\n   - Turn RIGHT from NORTH to face EAST.\n     - Action: \"RIGHT\".\n   - Move from row4 col4 into the door cell at row4 col5.\n     - Action: \"MOVE\".\n   - Move further EAST from row4 col5 to row4 col6.\n     - Action: \"MOVE\".\n\n8. Now in the right room at row4 col6 and still facing EAST, we must face NORTH to approach the BOX which is in row3 col6. Turn LEFT (from EAST to NORTH).\n   - Action: \"LEFT\".\n\n9. Finally, with the BOX cell (row3 col6) directly in front, pick up the BOX.\n   - Action: \"PICKUP\".\n\nThis sequence of 18 actions ensures the agent collects the KEY, uses it to unlock the door, drops the KEY so that it may pick up the BOX, and finally picks up the BOX from the other room."}
