    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.
    

    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:
    <final_answer>
        [""RIGHT"", ""TAKE"", ..., ""DROP""]
    </final_answer>

    
    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:
    - a direction to move in (""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"")
    - ""TAKE"" to take the energy token
    - ""DROP"" to drop the energy token

    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:
    - You must not move out of the grid.
    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.
    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). 
    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.
    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.
    - At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens
    - Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens
    Adhering to these rules is VERY IMPORTANT.

    Think about this before writing your output. Use only xml tags for formatting your output. Do not use json.
    
    
You should first give your first 10 actions. Based on those actions, an updated grid will be given to you, after which you will have to give your entire action sequence.

    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.
    

    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:
    <final_answer>
        [""RIGHT"", ""TAKE"", ..., ""DROP""]
    </final_answer>

    
    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:
    - a direction to move in (""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"")
    - ""TAKE"" to take the energy token
    - ""DROP"" to drop the energy token

    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:
    - You must not move out of the grid.
    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.
    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). 
    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.
    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.
    - At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens
    - Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens
    Adhering to these rules is VERY IMPORTANT.

    Think about this before writing your output. Use only xml tags for formatting your output. Do not use json.
    
    
You should first give your first 10 actions. Based on those actions, an updated grid will be given to you, after which you will have to give your entire action sequence.

    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:
    <final_answer>
        [""RIGHT"", ""TAKE"", ..., ""DROP""]
    </final_answer>

    
    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:
    - a direction to move in (""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"")
    - ""TAKE"" to take the energy token
    - ""DROP"" to drop the energy token

    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:
    - You must not move out of the grid.
    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.
    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). 
    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.
    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.
    - At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens
    - Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens
    Adhering to these rules is VERY IMPORTANT.

    Think about this before writing your output. Use only xml tags for formatting your output. Do not use json.
    
    
You should first give your first 10 actions. Based on those actions, an updated grid will be given to you, after which you will have to give your entire action sequence.

    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started.

    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.
    

    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:
    <final_answer>
        [""RIGHT"", ""TAKE"", ..., ""DROP""]
    </final_answer>

    
    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:
    - a direction to move in (""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"")
    - ""TAKE"" to take the energy token
    - ""DROP"" to drop the energy token

    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:
    - You must not move out of the grid.
    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.
    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). 
    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.
    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.
    - At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens
    - Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens
    Adhering to these rules is VERY IMPORTANT.

    Think about this before writing your output. Use only xml tags for formatting your output. Do not use json.
    
    
You should first give your first 10 actions. Based on those actions, an updated grid will be given to you, after which you will have to give your entire action sequence.

    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.
    

    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:
    <final_answer>
        [""RIGHT"", ""TAKE"", ..., ""DROP""]
    </final_answer>

    
    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:
    - a direction to move in (""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"")
    - ""TAKE"" to take the energy token
    - ""DROP"" to drop the energy token

    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:
    - You must not move out of the grid.
    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.
    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). 
    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.
    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.

    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.
    

    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:
    <final_answer>
        [""RIGHT"", ""TAKE"", ..., ""DROP""]
    </final_answer>

    
    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:
    - a direction to move in (""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"")
    - ""TAKE"" to take the energy token
    - ""DROP"" to drop the energy token

    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:
    - You must not move out of the grid.
    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.
    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). 
    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.
    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.
    - At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens
    - Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens
    Adhering to these rules is VERY IMPORTANT.

    Think about this before writing your output. Use only xml tags for formatting your output. Do not use json.
    
    
You should first give your first 10 actions. Based on those actions, an updated grid will be given to you, after which you will have to give your entire action sequence.

    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.
    

    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:
    <final_answer>
        [""RIGHT"", ""TAKE"", ..., ""DROP""]
    </final_answer>

    
    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:
    - a direction to move in (""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"")
    - ""TAKE"" to take the energy token
    - ""DROP"" to drop the energy token

    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:
    - You must not move out of the grid.
    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.
    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). 
    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.
    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.
    - At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens
    - Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens
    Adhering to these rules is VERY IMPORTANT.

    Think about this before writing your output. Use only xml tags for formatting your output. Do not use json.
    
    
You should first give your first 10 actions. Based on those actions, an updated grid will be given to you, after which you will have to give your entire action sequence.

You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.
    

    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:
    <final_answer>
        [""RIGHT"", ""TAKE"", ..., ""DROP""]
    </final_answer>

    
    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:
    - a direction to move in (""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"")
    - ""TAKE"" to take the energy token
    - ""DROP"" to drop the energy token

    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:
    - You must not move out of the grid.
    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.
    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). 
    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.
    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.
    - At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens
    - Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens
    Adhering to these rules is VERY IMPORTANT.

    Think about this before writing your output. Use only xml tags for formatting your output. Do not use json.
    
    
You should first give your first 10 actions. Based on those actions, an updated grid will be given to you, after which you will have to give your entire action sequence.

    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.
    

    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:
    <final_answer>
        [""RIGHT"", ""TAKE"", ..., ""DROP""]
    </final_answer>

    
    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:
    - a direction to move in (""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"")
    - ""TAKE"" to take the energy token
    - ""DROP"" to drop the energy token

    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:
    - You must not move out of the grid.
    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.
    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). 
    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.
    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.
    - At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens
    - Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens
    Adhering to these rules is VERY IMPORTANT.

    Think about this before writing your output. Use only xml tags for formatting your output. Do not use json.
    
    
You should first give your first 10 actions. Based on those actions, an updated grid will be given to you, after which you will have to give your entire action sequence.

    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.
    

    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:
    <final_answer>
        [""RIGHT"", ""TAKE"", ..., ""DROP""]
    </final_answer>

    
    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:
    - a direction to move in (""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"")
    - ""TAKE"" to take the energy token
    - ""DROP"" to drop the energy token

    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:
    - You must not move out of the grid.
    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.
    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). 
    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.
    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.
    - At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens
    - Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens

    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.
    

    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:
    <final_answer>
        [""RIGHT"", ""TAKE"", ..., ""DROP""]
    </final_answer>

    
    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:
    - a direction to move in (""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"")
    - ""TAKE"" to take the energy token
    - ""DROP"" to drop the energy token

    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:
    - You must not move out of the grid.
    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.
    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). 
    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.
    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.
    - At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens
    - Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens
    Adhering to these rules is VERY IMPORTANT.

    Think about this before writing your output. Use only xml tags for formatting your output. Do not use json.
    
    
You should first give your first 10 actions. Based on those actions, an updated grid will be given to you, after which you will have to give your entire action sequence.

    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.
    

    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:
    <final_answer>
        [""RIGHT"", ""TAKE"", ..., ""DROP""]
    </final_answer>

    
    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:
    - a direction to move in (""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"")
    - ""TAKE"" to take the energy token
    - ""DROP"" to drop the energy token

    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:
    - You must not move out of the grid.
    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.
    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). 
    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.
    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.
    - At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens
    - Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens
    Adhering to these rules is VERY IMPORTANT.

    Think about this before writing your output. Use only xml tags for formatting your output. Do not use json.
    
    
You should first give your first 10 actions. Based on those actions, an updated grid will be given to you, after which you will have to give your entire action sequence.

    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:
    - a direction to move in (""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"")
    - ""TAKE"" to take the energy token
    - ""DROP"" to drop the energy token

    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:
    - You must not move out of the grid.
    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.
    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). 
    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.
    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.
    - At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens
    - Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens

    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.
    

    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:

    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:

    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.
    

    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:
    <final_answer>
        [""RIGHT"", ""TAKE"", ..., ""DROP""]
    </final_answer>

    
    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:
    - a direction to move in (""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"")
    - ""TAKE"" to take the energy token
    - ""DROP"" to drop the energy token

    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:
    - You must not move out of the grid.
    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.
    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). 
    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.
    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.
    - At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens
    - Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens
    Adhering to these rules is VERY IMPORTANT.

    Think about this before writing your output. Use only xml tags for formatting your output. Do not use json.
    
    
You should first give your first 10 actions. Based on those actions, an updated grid will be given to you, after which you will have to give your entire action sequence.

    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.
    

    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:
    <final_answer>
        [""RIGHT"", ""TAKE"", ..., ""DROP""]
    </final_answer>

    
    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:
    - a direction to move in (""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"")
    - ""TAKE"" to take the energy token
    - ""DROP"" to drop the energy token

    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:
    - You must not move out of the grid.
    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.
    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). 
    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.
    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.
    - At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens
    - Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens
    Adhering to these rules is VERY IMPORTANT.

    Think about this before writing your output. Use only xml tags for formatting your output. Do not use json.
    
    
You should first give your first 10 actions. Based on those actions, an updated grid will be given to you, after which you will have to give your entire action sequence.

At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.
    

    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:
    <final_answer>
        [""RIGHT"", ""TAKE"", ..., ""DROP""]
    </final_answer>

    
    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:
    - a direction to move in (""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"")
    - ""TAKE"" to take the energy token
    - ""DROP"" to drop the energy token

    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:
    - You must not move out of the grid.
    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.
    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). 
    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.
    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.
    - At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens
    - Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens
    Adhering to these rules is VERY IMPORTANT.

    Think about this before writing your output. Use only xml tags for formatting your output. Do not use json.
    
    
You should first give your first 10 actions. Based on those actions, an updated grid will be given to you, after which you will have to give your entire action sequence.

    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'.

    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.
    

    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:
    <final_answer>
        [""RIGHT"", ""TAKE"", ..., ""DROP""]
    </final_answer>

    
    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:
    - a direction to move in (""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"")
    - ""TAKE"" to take the energy token
    - ""DROP"" to drop the energy token

    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:
    - You must not move out of the grid.
    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.
    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). 
    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.
    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.
    - At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens
    - Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens
    Adhering to these rules is VERY IMPORTANT.

    Think about this before writing your output. Use only xml tags for formatting your output. Do not use json.
    
    
You should first give your first 10 actions. Based on those actions, an updated grid will be given to you, after which you will have to give your entire action sequence.

    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.
    

    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:
    <final_answer>
        [""RIGHT"", ""TAKE"", ..., ""DROP""]
    </final_answer>

    
    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:
    - a direction to move in (""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"")
    - ""TAKE"" to take the energy token
    - ""DROP"" to drop the energy token

    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:
    - You must not move out of the grid.
    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.
    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). 
    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.
    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.
    - At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens
    - Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens
    Adhering to these rules is VERY IMPORTANT.

    Think about this before writing your output. Use only xml tags for formatting your output. Do not use json.

    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.
    

    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:
    <final_answer>
        [""RIGHT"", ""TAKE"", ..., ""DROP""]
    </final_answer>

    
    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:
    - a direction to move in (""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"")
    - ""TAKE"" to take the energy token
    - ""DROP"" to drop the energy token

    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:
    - You must not move out of the grid.
    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.
    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). 
    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.
    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.
    - At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens
    - Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens
    Adhering to these rules is VERY IMPORTANT.

    Think about this before writing your output. Use only xml tags for formatting your output. Do not use json.
    
    
You should first give your first 10 actions. Based on those actions, an updated grid will be given to you, after which you will have to give your entire action sequence.

    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.
    

    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:
    <final_answer>
        [""RIGHT"", ""TAKE"", ..., ""DROP""]
    </final_answer>

    
    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:
    - a direction to move in (""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"")
    - ""TAKE"" to take the energy token
    - ""DROP"" to drop the energy token

    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:
    - You must not move out of the grid.
    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.
    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). 
    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.
    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.
    - At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens
    - Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens
    Adhering to these rules is VERY IMPORTANT.

    Think about this before writing your output. Use only xml tags for formatting your output. Do not use json.
    
    
You should first give your first 10 actions. Based on those actions, an updated grid will be given to you, after which you will have to give your entire action sequence.

The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.
    

    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:
    <final_answer>
        [""RIGHT"", ""TAKE"", ..., ""DROP""]
    </final_answer>

    
    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:
    - a direction to move in (""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"")
    - ""TAKE"" to take the energy token
    - ""DROP"" to drop the energy token

    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:
    - You must not move out of the grid.
    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.
    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). 
    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.
    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.
    - At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens
    - Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens
    Adhering to these rules is VERY IMPORTANT.

    Think about this before writing your output. Use only xml tags for formatting your output. Do not use json.
    
    
You should first give your first 10 actions. Based on those actions, an updated grid will be given to you, after which you will have to give your entire action sequence.

    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell).

    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.
    

    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:
    <final_answer>
        [""RIGHT"", ""TAKE"", ..., ""DROP""]
    </final_answer>

    
    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:
    - a direction to move in (""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"")
    - ""TAKE"" to take the energy token
    - ""DROP"" to drop the energy token

    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:
    - You must not move out of the grid.
    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.
    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). 
    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.
    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.
    - At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens
    - Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens
    Adhering to these rules is VERY IMPORTANT.

    Think about this before writing your output. Use only xml tags for formatting your output. Do not use json.
    
    
You should first give your first 10 actions. Based on those actions, an updated grid will be given to you, after which you will have to give your entire action sequence.

    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.
    

    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:
    <final_answer>
        [""RIGHT"", ""TAKE"", ..., ""DROP""]
    </final_answer>

    
    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:
    - a direction to move in (""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"")
    - ""TAKE"" to take the energy token
    - ""DROP"" to drop the energy token

    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:
    - You must not move out of the grid.
    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.
    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). 
    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.
    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.

    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.
    

    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:
    <final_answer>
        [""RIGHT"", ""TAKE"", ..., ""DROP""]
    </final_answer>

    
    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:
    - a direction to move in (""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"")
    - ""TAKE"" to take the energy token
    - ""DROP"" to drop the energy token

    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:
    - You must not move out of the grid.
    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.
    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). 
    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.
    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.
    - At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens
    - Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens
    Adhering to these rules is VERY IMPORTANT.

    Think about this before writing your output. Use only xml tags for formatting your output. Do not use json.
    
    
You should first give your first 10 actions. Based on those actions, an updated grid will be given to you, after which you will have to give your entire action sequence.

    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.
    

    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:
    <final_answer>
        [""RIGHT"", ""TAKE"", ..., ""DROP""]
    </final_answer>

    
    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:
    - a direction to move in (""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"")
    - ""TAKE"" to take the energy token
    - ""DROP"" to drop the energy token

    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:
    - You must not move out of the grid.
    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.
    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). 
    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.
    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.
    - At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens
    - Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens
    Adhering to these rules is VERY IMPORTANT.

    Think about this before writing your output. Use only xml tags for formatting your output. Do not use json.
    
    
You should first give your first 10 actions. Based on those actions, an updated grid will be given to you, after which you will have to give your entire action sequence.

    - a direction to move in (""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"")
    - ""TAKE"" to take the energy token
    - ""DROP"" to drop the energy token

    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:
    - You must not move out of the grid.
    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.
    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). 
    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.
    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.
    - At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens
    - Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens
    Adhering to these rules is VERY IMPORTANT.

    Think about this before writing your output. Use only xml tags for formatting your output. Do not use json.
    
    
You should first give your first 10 actions. Based on those actions, an updated grid will be given to you, after which you will have to give your entire action sequence.

    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.

    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.
    

    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:
    <final_answer>
        [""RIGHT"", ""TAKE"", ..., ""DROP""]
    </final_answer>

    
    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:
    - a direction to move in (""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"")
    - ""TAKE"" to take the energy token
    - ""DROP"" to drop the energy token

    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:
    - You must not move out of the grid.
    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.
    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). 
    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.
    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.
    - At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens
    - Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens
    Adhering to these rules is VERY IMPORTANT.

    Think about this before writing your output. Use only xml tags for formatting your output. Do not use json.
    
    
You should first give your first 10 actions. Based on those actions, an updated grid will be given to you, after which you will have to give your entire action sequence.

    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.
    

    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:
    <final_answer>
        [""RIGHT"", ""TAKE"", ..., ""DROP""]
    </final_answer>

    
    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:
    - a direction to move in (""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"")
    - ""TAKE"" to take the energy token
    - ""DROP"" to drop the energy token

    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:
    - You must not move out of the grid.
    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.
    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). 
    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.
    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.
    - At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens
    - Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens
    Adhering to these rules is VERY IMPORTANT.

    Think about this before writing your output. Use only xml tags for formatting your output. Do not use json.
    
    
You should first give your first 10 actions. Based on those actions, an updated grid will be given to you, after which you will have to give your entire action sequence.

Explanation:
• Cycle 1 (Actions 1–7): Starting at [5,3], move DOWN to [6,3] where an energy token is present. TAKE it. Then move RIGHT to [6,4] (another token) and TAKE it. Next, use UPLEFT to return directly to [5,3] and use two DROP actions to deposit both tokens.
• Cycle 2 (Actions 8–16): From the starting cell, move upward twice (“UP” then “UP”) to reach [3,3] (which holds an energy token). TAKE that token, then move RIGHT to [3,4] (another energy token) and TAKE it. Return by moving DOWNLEFT (to [4,3]) and then DOWN (back to [5,3]). Finally, drop both tokens with two DROP actions.
This sequence uses 16 actions (under the 20–action limit), does not run off the grid, and obeys the rule of carrying at most 2 tokens at any time.",cot,openai/o3-mini,inner_cluster_block,True,False,True

</final_answer> 

Below is the step‐by‐step reasoning:

1. Starting at [6,6], the plan is to make short round‐trips so that we pick tokens and then return to [6,6] to drop them. (Only tokens dropped at the starting cell count toward your score, and you can carry at most 2 at a time.) 

Round Trip 1 (8 actions):
– Action 1: “LEFT” moves you from [6,6] to [6,5] where an energy token “E” is present.
– Action 2: “TAKE” picks up the token at [6,5].
– Action 3: “RIGHT” moves you back to [6,6].
– Action 4: “RIGHT” moves you to [6,7] (another adjacent cell with “E”).
– Action 5: “TAKE” picks up the token at [6,7] (now carrying 2 tokens).
– Action 6: “LEFT” brings you back to [6,6].
– Actions 7–8: “DROP”, “DROP” to deposit both tokens at the start cell.

Round Trip 2 (7 actions):
– Action 9: “UP” moves you from [6,6] to [5,6] where there is an “E.”
– Action 10: “TAKE” picks up the token at [5,6].
– Action 11: “LEFT” takes you to [5,5] (which also has an “E”).
– Action 12: “TAKE” picks up that token (now 2 in hand).
– Action 13: “DOWNRIGHT” moves you diagonally from [5,5] back to [6,6].
– Actions 14–15: “DROP”, “DROP” deposit both tokens.

Round Trip 3 (4 actions):
– Action 16: “UPRIGHT” moves you diagonally from [6,6] to [5,7] (an adjacent cell with an “E”).
– Action 17: “TAKE” picks up the token.
– Action 18: “DOWNLEFT” takes you back to [6,6].
– Action 19: “DROP” deposits this single token.

These 19 actions (within the 20‐action limit) ensure you deposit a total of 5 energy tokens at the starting cell. (Movement steps naturally cost 0.3 tokens each, but here the focus is on maximizing the tokens deposited by efficient, short trips.)",cot,openai/o3-mini,inner_cluster_block,True,False,True

    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.
    

    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:
    <final_answer>
        [""RIGHT"", ""TAKE"", ..., ""DROP""]
    </final_answer>

    
    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:
    - a direction to move in (""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"")
    - ""TAKE"" to take the energy token
    - ""DROP"" to drop the energy token

    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:
    - You must not move out of the grid.
    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.
    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). 
    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.
    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.
    - At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens
    - Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens
    Adhering to these rules is VERY IMPORTANT.

    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.
    

    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:
    <final_answer>
        [""RIGHT"", ""TAKE"", ..., ""DROP""]
    </final_answer>

    
    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:
    - a direction to move in (""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"")
    - ""TAKE"" to take the energy token
    - ""DROP"" to drop the energy token

    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:
    - You must not move out of the grid.
    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.
    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). 
    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.
    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.
    - At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens
    - Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens
    Adhering to these rules is VERY IMPORTANT.

</final_answer>  

Let's explain the idea briefly:

• Our starting position is [3,6]. We want to deposit as many energy tokens as possible (only tokens dropped at start count).   
• We know that among the 8 neighbors of [3,6] only three hold energy (cells [3,5], [4,5] and [4,7]). However, one token is “two‐steps away” (at [3,4]) that in a separate trip would cost extra moves.  
• To maximize our result in no more than 20 actions we “bundle” two tokens in one trip when possible.  

In the plan above we do:
1. A two‐token round trip “leftward” that goes:
  – from [3,6] LEFT → [3,5] (token present) then TAKE,
  – further LEFT to [3,4] (token present) then TAKE,
  – return to [3,6] via RIGHT, RIGHT and then DROP (twice) to deposit those two tokens.
This uses 8 actions.  

2. A one‐token round trip downward‐left into cell [4,5] (which is adjacent) using DOWNLEFT, TAKE, UPRIGHT and DROP (4 actions).  

3. A one‐token round trip downward‐right into cell [4,7] (also adjacent) using DOWNRIGHT, TAKE, UPLEFT and DROP (4 actions).  

That gives a total of 8+4+4=16 actions (leaving 4 spare, which is acceptable as the limit is 20). Only the tokens dropped at the starting cell are scored, and we end having deposited 4 tokens.  

This sequence obeys all the movement, capacity, and turn‐limit rules.",cot,openai/o3-mini,inner_cluster_block,True,False,True

Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.
    

    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:
    <final_answer>
        [""RIGHT"", ""TAKE"", ..., ""DROP""]
    </final_answer>

    
    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:
    - a direction to move in (""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"")
    - ""TAKE"" to take the energy token
    - ""DROP"" to drop the energy token

    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:
    - You must not move out of the grid.
    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.
    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). 
    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.
    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.
    - At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens
    - Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens
    Adhering to these rules is VERY IMPORTANT.

    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.
    

    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:
    <final_answer>
        [""RIGHT"", ""TAKE"", ..., ""DROP""]
    </final_answer>

    
    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:
    - a direction to move in (""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"")
    - ""TAKE"" to take the energy token
    - ""DROP"" to drop the energy token

    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:
    - You must not move out of the grid.
    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.
    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). 
    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.
    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.
    - At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens
    - Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens
    Adhering to these rules is VERY IMPORTANT.

Below is the reasoning:

• We want to “deposit” energy tokens at the starting cell A at [7,7] and must obey the 20‐action limit.
• Noticing that nearby tokens can reduce movement cost, we looked at the cells in row 5 where tokens exist at [5,5] and [5,6]. From [7,7] moving there is very efficient:
 – Trip 1: From [7,7] we go UPLEFT twice reaching [5,5] (where “TAKE” gets the token) then move RIGHT to [5,6] (and “TAKE” another token). With these two tokens (the 2–token carrying capacity) we return by first moving DOWNRIGHT then DOWN back to the start and “DROP” our energy. This trip uses 8 actions.
• With 12 actions remaining (total allowed 20), we can make a second efficient trip. Using tokens from row 4 (which has tokens at [4,6] and [4,5]):
 – Trip 2: Move from [7,7] UPLEFT to (6,6), then UP twice to [4,6] (via [5,6]). At [4,6] “TAKE” the token, then move LEFT to [4,5] and “TAKE” its token. Finally, return to A by moving DOWNRIGHT twice and DOWN to [7,7] and “DROP” the tokens.
• This trip takes 10 actions. The overall sequence uses 18 actions, leaving us within the 20–action limit.
• All moves remain within the grid; tokens are taken only from cells known to have one; and we never carry more than 2 tokens.

This plan maximizes deposited tokens while keeping movement (which “costs” 0.3 per step) minimal.",cot,openai/o3-mini,inner_cluster_free,True,False,True

I chose a strategy that works in three “mini‐round trips” from the starting cell [5,5]:

• Round Trip 1 (actions 1–7):  
 – Move from [5,5] one cell LEFT to [5,4] (which has an energy token).  
 – TAKE that token.  
 – Then move DOWNRIGHT from [5,4] to [6,5] (where another token sits) and TAKE it.  
 – Move UP to return directly to the start and then DROP both tokens (one DROP per token).  

• Round Trip 2 (actions 8–11):  
 – From the start, move DOWNLEFT to [6,4] (another adjacent token) and TAKE it.  
 – Return by moving UPRIGHT back to [5,5] and DROP that token.

• Round Trip 3 (actions 12–19):  
 – From [5,5] move RIGHT three times to reach [5,8] (a token further out).  
 – TAKE at [5,8].  
 – Then return by moving LEFT three times back to [5,5] and DROP the token.

This plan uses 19 actions (well within the 20–action limit) and deposits a total of 4 energy tokens at the start. Each move “costs” 0.3 tokens, but since the game’s score counts only those tokens dropped at the starting cell, this route maximizes the deposit within the given constraints.",cot,openai/o3-mini,inner_leftRight_block,True,False,True

    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.
    

    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:
    <final_answer>
        [""RIGHT"", ""TAKE"", ..., ""DROP""]
    </final_answer>

    
    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:
    - a direction to move in (""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"")
    - ""TAKE"" to take the energy token
    - ""DROP"" to drop the energy token

    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:
    - You must not move out of the grid.
    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.
    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). 
    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.
    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.
    - At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens
    - Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens
    Adhering to these rules is VERY IMPORTANT.

Explanation:
• Trip 1 (actions 1–8): Starting at (7,7), we go LEFT to (7,6) (which has an energy token), TAKE it; then return RIGHT to (7,7) and then RIGHT again to (7,8) (which has a token), TAKE it; finally, we move LEFT back to (7,7) and DROP both tokens.
• Trip 2 (actions 9–12): From (7,7) we go UP to (6,7) (which contains a token), TAKE it, then return DOWN to (7,7) and DROP it.
• Trip 3 (actions 13–20): From (7,7) we go UPLEFT to (6,6) (which has a token), TAKE it; then move RIGHT twice (passing through (6,7)) to arrive at (6,8) (which has a token), TAKE it; finally, we return by moving DOWNLEFT directly to (7,7) and DROP both tokens.
All moves stay within the grid, no cell without a token is targeted by TAKE, the capacity of 2 tokens is not exceeded, and the full plan uses exactly 20 actions.",cot,openai/o3-mini,inner_leftRight_block,True,False,True

    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:
    - a direction to move in (""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"")
    - ""TAKE"" to take the energy token
    - ""DROP"" to drop the energy token

    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:
    - You must not move out of the grid.
    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.
    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). 
    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.
    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.
    - At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens
    - Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens

    [""UPRIGHT"", ""TAKE"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DROP""]
</final_answer>

We can explain the reasoning briefly. Starting at [6,5] the only immediately adjacent energy‐cell is at [5,6]. By moving UPRIGHT (from [6,5] to [5,6]), you reach that token in one move. Then you “TAKE” it (using your capacity of 2). Next, a single “DOWNLEFT” brings you directly back to your starting cell [6,5] where you “DROP” the token. This 4–action plan is optimal because it minimizes the number of moves (each costing 0.3 tokens) while depositing an energy token on your start cell.",cot,openai/o3-mini,inner_leftRight_block,True,False,True

    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started.

</final_answer> 

Explanation:
• Starting at cell [5,4], the first trip picks up the energy token at [4,3] (via ""UPLEFT"") then moves one more step “UPLEFT” to [3,2] to collect a second token. After that the agent returns by moving “DOWNRIGHT” twice (back via [4,3] then to the start) and drops the two tokens.
• In the second trip the agent leaves the starting cell by moving “DOWN” to cell [6,4] (which is adjacent and holds a token), uses “TAKE” there, then goes “LEFT” to cell [6,3] (also containing a token) and takes that. Finally a single “UPRIGHT” returns the agent to [5,4] where two “DROP” actions deposit the tokens.
• This 15‐action plan (well under the 20–action limit) obeys the rules (never carrying more than 2 tokens, only moving into non–obstacle cells, and not moving off the grid) and ends with 4 tokens dropped at the starting cell.
 
Each move costs 0.3 energy tokens, so the net final score will be the 4 dropped tokens minus the small cost from 7 movement steps in the two trips. The plan maximizes the nearby energy collection within the allowed actions.",cot,openai/o3-mini,inner_leftRight_block,True,False,True

</final_answer> 

Explanation:
• Trip 1 (actions 1–6): From the starting cell [5,7], we go LEFT to [5,6] (which holds an “E”), TAKE that token, then move DOWNRIGHT to [6,7] (costing 0.3 of the carried token) where we TAKE a second token. Finally, we move UP back to [5,7] (losing another 0.3 from the carried amount) and DROP—all in 6 actions.
• Trip 2 (actions 7–12): We then go RIGHT to [5,8] (an “E”), TAKE it, then move UPLEFT to [4,7] where we TAKE another “E”. A move DOWN returns us to the starting cell and a DROP deposits the tokens.
• Trip 3 (actions 13–16): With 8 actions left, we make a one‐token trip: from [5,7] we move UPLEFT to [4,6], TAKE the “E” there, then return DOWNRIGHT to [5,7] (incurring 0.3 cost) and DROP.
• Trip 4 (actions 17–20): Finally, we go DOWNLEFT to [6,6] (which also has an “E”), TAKE it, then use UPRIGHT to get back to [5,7] (again incurring 0.3 while carrying) and DROP.

Each step has been chosen so that:
– We never leave the grid.
– We only TAKE from cells with energy.
– We never carry more than 2 tokens.
– The entire plan fits within 20 actions.
At the end, the dropped tokens in the starting cell are the final collected energy.",cot,openai/o3-mini,inner_leftRight_free,True,False,True

    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.
    

    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:
    <final_answer>
        [""RIGHT"", ""TAKE"", ..., ""DROP""]
    </final_answer>

    
    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:
    - a direction to move in (""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"")
    - ""TAKE"" to take the energy token
    - ""DROP"" to drop the energy token

    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:
    - You must not move out of the grid.
    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.
    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). 
    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.
    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.
    - At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens
    - Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens
    Adhering to these rules is VERY IMPORTANT.

</final_answer> 

In this solution the idea is to make two short trips from the starting cell at [6,5]. In the first trip the agent goes one step left to [6,4] – where an energy token is present – takes that token, then uses a diagonal move (DOWNRIGHT) to move to [7,5] (which also contains an energy token), takes that token, returns (with an UP move) to the starting cell, and finally drops both tokens. This cycle uses 6 actions.

In the second cycle the agent leaves [6,5] by going LEFT twice (first to [6,4], then to [6,3] – where a token is present), does a TAKE, then goes DOWNLEFT to move to [7,2] (picking up the second token via TAKE), retraces its steps (using UPRIGHT, then two RIGHT moves to return to [6,5]) and finally uses DROP to offload the two tokens. This cycle uses another 9 actions. 

A total of 15 actions are used (well within the 20‐action limit), and 4 tokens are deposited in the starting cell. The other moves and tokens in the grid are out of reach within the 20–action constraint, so this route maximizes the score under the rules given.",cot,openai/o3-mini,inner_leftRight_free,True,False,True

    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.
    

    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:
    <final_answer>
        [""RIGHT"", ""TAKE"", ..., ""DROP""]

    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:
    - a direction to move in (""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"")
    - ""TAKE"" to take the energy token
    - ""DROP"" to drop the energy token

    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:
    - You must not move out of the grid.
    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.
    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). 
    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.
    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.

In this solution we make three “trips” from the start cell [5,4] (where A is) to nearby energy‐cells and then return to deposit them. 

Trip 1 (7 actions):
• From [5,4] go LEFT to [5,3] – there is an “E”. (Action: ""LEFT"")
• TAKE the token there. (Action: ""TAKE"")
• Move UP from [5,3] to [4,3] – that cell has an “E”. (Action: ""UP"")
• TAKE that token. (Action: ""TAKE"")
• Then move DOWNRIGHT from [4,3] back to the starting cell [5,4]. (Action: ""DOWNRIGHT"")
• DROP a token (Action: ""DROP"")
• DROP the other token. (Action: ""DROP"")

Trip 2 (7 actions):
• From [5,4] move RIGHT to [5,5] (Action: ""RIGHT"") where there is an “E.”
• TAKE the token (Action: ""TAKE"")
• Go DOWN to [6,5] (Action: ""DOWN"") where there is another “E.”
• TAKE that token (Action: ""TAKE"")
• Return to [5,4] by moving UPLEFT (Action: ""UPLEFT"")
• DROP one token (Action: ""DROP"")
• DROP the second token (Action: ""DROP"")

Trip 3 (4 actions):
• From [5,4] move UP to [4,4] (Action: ""UP"") where an “E” is still available.
• TAKE that token (Action: ""TAKE"")
• Move DOWN back to [5,4] (Action: ""DOWN"")
• DROP the token (Action: ""DROP"")

This sequence uses 18 actions in total (8 moves among them cost 0.3 each, i.e. 8 × 0.3 = 2.4 tokens cost). Even though we have 2 spare actions available, no extra tokens are accessible nearby to justify the extra cost. Only the tokens dropped in the starting cell count towards the score, and these three trips deposit a total of 5 tokens there.

This meets the constraints of staying in the grid, not picking up from an empty cell, not carrying more than 2 tokens at a time, and using fewer than 20 actions overall.",cot,openai/o3-mini,inner_leftRight_free,True,False,True

Explanation:
• Trip 1 (Actions 1–12): From the starting cell [7,7] we head left three times to reach [7,4] (which has an energy token), then TAKE that token. We then move one further left to [7,3] (with another token) and TAKE it. With our two-token capacity full, we return by moving right four times back to [7,7] and then DROP both tokens.
• Trip 2 (Actions 13–16): We then move UP to [6,7] (which holds a token), TAKE it, return DOWN to [7,7], and DROP it.
• Trip 3 (Actions 17–20): Lastly, we move DOWN to [8,7] (which holds a token), TAKE it, go UP back to [7,7], and DROP it.

This 20‐action plan deposits 4 energy tokens in the starting cell while obeying grid bounds, avoiding obstacles, respecting the two‐token carrying limit, and accounting for the step action cost.",cot,openai/o3-mini,inner_random_block,True,False,True

This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.
    

    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:
    <final_answer>
        [""RIGHT"", ""TAKE"", ..., ""DROP""]
    </final_answer>

    
    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:
    - a direction to move in (""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"")
    - ""TAKE"" to take the energy token
    - ""DROP"" to drop the energy token

    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:
    - You must not move out of the grid.
    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.
    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). 
    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.
    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.
    - At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens
    - Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens
    Adhering to these rules is VERY IMPORTANT.

    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.
    

    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:
    <final_answer>
        [""RIGHT"", ""TAKE"", ..., ""DROP""]
    </final_answer>

    
    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:
    - a direction to move in (""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"")
    - ""TAKE"" to take the energy token
    - ""DROP"" to drop the energy token

    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:
    - You must not move out of the grid.
    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.
    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). 
    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.
    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.
    - At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens
    - Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens
    Adhering to these rules is VERY IMPORTANT.

    Think about this before writing your output. Use only xml tags for formatting your output. Do not use json.

Let's think step by step.","<final_answer>
    [""RIGHT"", ""RIGHT"", ""TAKE"", ""RIGHT"", ""TAKE"", ""LEFT"", ""LEFT"", ""LEFT"", ""DROP"", ""DROP"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""TAKE"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DROP"", ""DOWNRIGHT"", ""TAKE"", ""UPLEFT"", ""DROP""]
</final_answer> 

Below is the reasoning:

• We start at cell [3,5]. In the first “round‐trip” we go right to pick up two tokens that lie on the row (at [3,7] and [3,8]) and then return to the starting cell to drop them. The actions are:
 1. ""RIGHT""   (from [3,5] to [3,6])
 2. ""RIGHT""   (from [3,6] to [3,7] where there is an “E”)
 3. ""TAKE""   (take the token at [3,7])
 4. ""RIGHT""   (from [3,7] to [3,8] where there is an “E”)
 5. ""TAKE""   (take the token at [3,8]; now you carry 2 tokens – the maximum)
 6. ""LEFT""   (move from [3,8] back to [3,7])
 7. ""LEFT""   (move from [3,7] to [3,6])
 8. ""LEFT""   (move from [3,6] to [3,5] returning to base)
 9. ""DROP""   (drop one token at the starting cell)
 10. ""DROP""   (drop the second token)

• In the next “round‐trip” (using 4 actions) we exploit the fact that two cells immediately diagonal to the starting cell contain tokens. First, from [3,5] we head “DOWNLEFT” to [4,4]:
 11. ""DOWNLEFT""  (from base [3,5] to [4,4] – a diagonal move; there is an “E” at [4,4])
 12. ""TAKE""   (take the token at [4,4]; now carrying 1)
 13. ""UPRIGHT""  (move diagonally from [4,4] back to [3,5]) 
 14. ""DROP""   (drop the token at the start)

• Finally, we do a similar 4‐action round picking up the token from the other adjacent diagonal cell:
 15. ""DOWNRIGHT""  (from base [3,5] to [4,6] where an “E” is located)
 16. ""TAKE""   (take the token at [4,6])
 17. ""UPLEFT""   (move diagonally from [4,6] back to [3,5])
 18. ""DROP""   (drop the token at base)

This entire plan uses 18 actions (within the 20–action limit). At the end the starting cell has 4 tokens dropped. (Note that each movement “step” costs 0.3 energy tokens, so by keeping the moves as few as possible – and especially by minimizing the number of steps taken while carrying tokens – we keep the “cost” low.) 

This sequence obeys all the rules:
• We never move off the 11×11 grid.
• We only “TAKE” from a cell that has an energy token.
• We never carry more than 2 tokens.
• The total number of actions is 18 (which is ≤20).
• Finally, all collected tokens are “DROPPED” in the starting cell.

Feel free to use this valid move‐sequence as the answer.",cot,openai/o3-mini,inner_random_free,True,False,True

    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.
    

    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:
    <final_answer>
        [""RIGHT"", ""TAKE"", ..., ""DROP""]
    </final_answer>

    
    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:
    - a direction to move in (""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"")
    - ""TAKE"" to take the energy token
    - ""DROP"" to drop the energy token

    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:
    - You must not move out of the grid.
    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.
    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). 
    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.

    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.
    

    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:
    <final_answer>
        [""RIGHT"", ""TAKE"", ..., ""DROP""]
    </final_answer>

    
    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:
    - a direction to move in (""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"")
    - ""TAKE"" to take the energy token
    - ""DROP"" to drop the energy token

    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:
    - You must not move out of the grid.
    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.
    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). 
    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.
    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.
    - At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens
    - Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens
    Adhering to these rules is VERY IMPORTANT.

At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.
    

    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:
    <final_answer>
        [""RIGHT"", ""TAKE"", ..., ""DROP""]

    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:
    - a direction to move in (""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"")
    - ""TAKE"" to take the energy token
    - ""DROP"" to drop the energy token

    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:
    - You must not move out of the grid.
    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.
    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). 
    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.
    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.
    - At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens
    - Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens
    Adhering to these rules is VERY IMPORTANT.

Explanation:
• We start at the starting cell [4,5]. Notice that several neighboring cells contain an energy token. In our plan we make five “round‐trip” sub‐routines. In each sub‐routine we:
 – leave the starting cell while empty (so no movement cost is “paid” on a carried token),
 – move to one of the adjacent cells that holds an “E”, use “TAKE” to pick it up,
 – return immediately to [4,5] (this move is with a carried token so it costs 0.3 tokens) and then 
 – “DROP” the token – which deposits it at the start (only dropped tokens count toward your score).
• The five trips (each using 4 actions) sum to 20 actions, and all moves remain inside the grid.
• This simple strategy obeys the restrictions (carrying at most one token at a time until drop and not exceeding 20 actions) and maximizes the tokens returned in our allowed budget of moves.

    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.
    

    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:
    <final_answer>
        [""RIGHT"", ""TAKE"", ..., ""DROP""]
    </final_answer>

    
    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:
    - a direction to move in (""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"")
    - ""TAKE"" to take the energy token
    - ""DROP"" to drop the energy token

    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:
    - You must not move out of the grid.
    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.
    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). 
    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.
    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.
    - At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens
    - Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens
    Adhering to these rules is VERY IMPORTANT.

Explanation:
• Run1 (actions 1–7): From the starting cell [4,3], move RIGHT to [4,4] (which has E), TAKE the token; then move DOWNLEFT to [5,3] (which has E) and TAKE that token; then move UP to return to [4,3] and DROP both tokens. This run uses 7 actions and deposits 2 tokens.
• Run2 (actions 8–16): From [4,3] move LEFT twice to reach [4,1] (which has E), TAKE the token; then move UP to reach [3,1] (which has E) and TAKE that token; then move DOWNRIGHT and RIGHT to return to [4,3] and DROP both tokens. This run uses 9 actions and deposits 2 tokens.
• Extra moves (actions 17–20): To use up the 20‐action limit without altering the final state, we move UP then DOWN and LEFT then RIGHT so that we end at the starting cell with empty hands.
Thus, a total of 4 tokens are collected and deposited at [4,3] within 20 actions.",cot,openai/o3-mini,inner_upDown_block,True,False,True

    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.
    

    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:
    <final_answer>
        [""RIGHT"", ""TAKE"", ..., ""DROP""]
    </final_answer>

    
    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:
    - a direction to move in (""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"")
    - ""TAKE"" to take the energy token
    - ""DROP"" to drop the energy token

    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:
    - You must not move out of the grid.
    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.
    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). 
    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.
    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.
    - At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens
    - Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens
    Adhering to these rules is VERY IMPORTANT.

</final_answer> 

Below is the reasoning behind this 18‐action plan (which is within the 20–action limit):

• We start at [3,4] (the “home” cell). In the first “trip” we deliberately bypass the token at [3,3] so we can later pick it with a cheap round‐trip. Instead, we go farther left to grab two tokens that lie at [3,2] and [3,1]. The sequence is:
 1. “LEFT” → from [3,4] to [3,3] (passing by without taking the token there)
 2. “LEFT” → arriving at [3,2] (which has an energy token)
 3. “TAKE” → collect token from [3,2]
 4. “LEFT” → move to [3,1] (which has a token)
 5. “TAKE” → collect token from [3,1] (now carrying two tokens, the maximum)
 6. “RIGHT” → go back to [3,2]
 7. “RIGHT” → continue to [3,3]
 8. “RIGHT” → return to starting cell [3,4]
 9. “DROP” → drop one token at home
 10. “DROP” → drop the second token  
  Now 2 tokens have been deposited.

• For the second trip we take two tokens that are immediately adjacent to the start:
 11. “LEFT” → move to [3,3] (this token was not picked earlier)
 12. “TAKE” → pick token from [3,3]
 13. “RIGHT” → return to [3,4]
 14. “RIGHT” → go to [3,5] (which has a token)
 15. “TAKE” → pick token from [3,5] (now full with 2 tokens)
 16. “LEFT” → head back to [3,4]
 17. “DROP” → drop one token
 18. “DROP” → drop the second token  
  Now 2 additional tokens are deposited; the total deposited tokens become 4.

This plan uses 18 actions (leaving 2 spare) and obeys all rules: not stepping outside the grid, not taking from an empty cell, not carrying more than 2 at a time, and only dropping tokens when back at the start.",cot,openai/o3-mini,inner_upDown_block,True,False,True

Below is the reasoning behind this plan:

We start at the cell [4,6] (our “home” cell). Our objective is to pick up tokens from elsewhere and then return and DROP them so they count for our score. Because we can carry at most 2 tokens at a time, it makes sense to “batch‐” when possible.

• Round Trip 1 (Actions 1–7):  
 – Move RIGHT to [4,7] (which contains a token “E”)  
 – TAKE the token  
 – Then move DOWN to [5,7] (another token “E”)  
 – TAKE the second token  
 – Move UPLEFT to return directly from [5,7] to [4,6]  
 – DROP the first token  
 – DROP the second token  
After this round, our starting cell now has 2 tokens (score = 2) and we have used 7 actions.

• Round Trip 2 (Actions 8–11):  
 – From [4,6] move UPLEFT to [3,5] (an adjacent diagonal cell that holds an “E”)  
 – TAKE that token  
 – Return by moving DOWNRIGHT from [3,5] back to [4,6]  
 – DROP the token at home  
Now our score increases by 1 (total = 3) and we have used 4 additional actions (total 11).

• Round Trip 3 (Actions 12–17):  
 – With 9 actions left we plan a relatively short trip for another token.  
 – From [4,6] move UPRIGHT to [3,7] (this intermediate cell is empty)  
 – Then move RIGHT to [3,8] where a token “E” is located  
 – TAKE this token  
 – Return by moving DOWNLEFT from [3,8] to [4,7]  
 – Then move LEFT from [4,7] to get back to [4,6]  
 – Finally, DROP the token  
This adds one more token to our score (total = 4) and uses 6 actions (overall 17 actions used).

We end with 17 actions, which is under the 20–action limit. All moves stay on the grid, tokens are taken only where they exist, we never hold more than 2 tokens, and we drop tokens only in the starting cell.",cot,openai/o3-mini,inner_upDown_block,True,False,True

    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.
    

    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:
    <final_answer>
        [""RIGHT"", ""TAKE"", ..., ""DROP""]
    </final_answer>

    
    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:
    - a direction to move in (""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"")
    - ""TAKE"" to take the energy token
    - ""DROP"" to drop the energy token

    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:
    - You must not move out of the grid.
    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.
    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). 
    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.
    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.
    - At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens
    - Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens
    Adhering to these rules is VERY IMPORTANT.

Explanation:
• Starting at [6,6], the first round‐trip goes left to [6,5] (which holds an energy token), takes it, then moves DOWNRIGHT to [7,6] (where another token is located), takes it, then moves UP back to the starting cell and drops both tokens.
• The second round‐trip starts at [6,6]: going RIGHT three times reaches [6,9] (where a token is available), takes it, then going DOWN reaches [7,9] (another token), takes it, and finally returns back by moving UPLEFT then two LEFT moves back to [6,6] for a DROP.
• This sequence uses 16 actions (only movement, TAKE and DROP) which is less than the allowed 20 actions.
• All moves remain within the 11×11 grid and respect the restrictions on movement, carrying capacity, and final drop at the starting cell.",cot,openai/o3-mini,inner_upDown_block,True,False,True

We can explain our reasoning briefly:

• We start at [6,4] (the “A” cell). Our plan is to make several short “round‐trip” excursions to nearby adjacent cells so that when we return to [6,4] we drop the tokens we picked up.
  
• In our first round trip we choose two adjacent cells that are “neighbors” both to [6,4] and to each other. For example, moving UP from [6,4] lands in [5,4] (which holds an “E”). After a TAKE there we then move LEFT to [5,3] (also containing an “E”), TAKE that token and then return with a single “DOWNRIGHT” move back to [6,4]. Finally we DROP both tokens (one DROP per token). This 7‐action sequence nets 2 tokens deposited.
  
• Then we do a one–token trip: from [6,4] we go UPRIGHT to [5,5], TAKE the token there, return via DOWNLEFT to [6,4] and then DROP it. (This one–token trip uses 4 actions.)
  
• Next we go for the fourth token with another similar one–token trip: from [6,4] we move DOWNRIGHT to [7,5], TAKE the token and return via UPLEFT back to the start, then DROP it (again 4 actions).
  
• In total our sequence uses 7 + 4 + 4 = 15 actions (leaving us spare actions under the 20–action limit) and deposits 4 tokens at the start.

This strategy obeys the rules (never going off–grid, only taking tokens where present, never exceeding a 2–token capacity and using only allowed actions) and maximizes our collection given the constraints.",cot,openai/o3-mini,inner_upDown_block,True,False,True

    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.

</final_answer> 

Below is the reasoning behind the plan:

1. Starting at [5,6] (where “A” is), the idea is to make a short “round‐trip” to pick up up to 2 tokens (remember carrying capacity is 2) and return with them to deposit at the start.

• Trip 1 – 2 tokens:
 a. Action 1: ""DOWNLEFT"" moves to [6,5] (an adjacent cell that has an “E”).
 b. Action 2: ""TAKE"" to pick up the token at [6,5].
 c. Action 3: ""RIGHT"" moves to [6,6] where another ""E"" is.
 d. Action 4: ""TAKE"" picks up that token.
 e. Action 5: ""UP"" brings you back to [5,6].
 f. Actions 6–7: “DROP” then “DROP” deposit the two tokens.

2. Trip 2 – 2 tokens:
 a. Action 8: ""UP"" moves from [5,6] to [4,6] (which contains an “E”).
 b. Action 9: ""TAKE"" its token.
 c. Action 10: ""RIGHT"" moves to [4,7] (another “E” is here).
 d. Action 11: ""TAKE"" collects that token.
 e. Action 12: ""DOWNLEFT"" returns to [5,6].
 f. Actions 13–14: Two ""DROP"" actions deposit both tokens.

3. Trip 3 – 1 token:
 a. Action 15: ""UPLEFT"" moves from [5,6] to [4,5] (an adjacent cell with an “E”).
 b. Action 16: ""TAKE"" picks up that token.
 c. Action 17: ""DOWNRIGHT"" moves back from [4,5] to [5,6].
 d. Action 18: ""DROP"" deposits the token.

This 18‐action plan (well within the 20–action limit) collects 5 tokens in total on the starting cell. Note that every movement “step” costs 0.3 energy tokens, so minimizing length of trips is important. The above route uses short moves and collects tokens from cells immediately adjacent to the starting cell.

All moves remain within the grid and obey capacity/direction rules.",cot,openai/o3-mini,inner_upDown_free,True,False,True

Explanation:
• Trip 1 (actions 1–8):
  – From starting cell (5,7) go LEFT to (5,6) and TAKE the token there.
  – Return by going RIGHT from (5,6) to (5,7) then RIGHT to (5,8) and TAKE the token.
  – Then move LEFT back to (5,7) and DROP both tokens.
• Trip 2 (actions 9–16):
  – From (5,7) go DOWN to (6,7) and TAKE its token.
  – Continue DOWN to (7,7) and TAKE its token.
  – Return UP twice (from (7,7) to (6,7) to (5,7)) and DROP both tokens.
• Trip 3 (actions 17–20):
  – Finally, from (5,7) go UPLEFT to (4,6) to TAKE its token.
  – Then return directly by going DOWNRIGHT back to (5,7) and DROP the token.

</final_answer> 

We explain our reasoning step‐by‐step:

1. Starting at [4,3], we first go LEFT to cell [4,2] (which holds an E) and TAKE that token.
2. Then we move DOWNRIGHT to [5,3] where another E is located and TAKE that token.
3. We return to our base [4,3] by moving UP and DROPPING both tokens (using two DROP actions). This completes a “trip” using 7 actions.
4. For our second trip, from base we move DOWNLEFT to [5,2] (which has an E) and TAKE it.
5. Next, we move DOWN to [6,2] (another E) and TAKE it.
6. We then head back toward base by moving UPRIGHT to [5,3] and UP to [4,3] and DROP the two tokens (again two DROP actions). That trip uses 8 actions.
7. With 5 actions left (total actions so far = 15), we make a third trip: we go UPLEFT to [3,2] where an untaken E lies, TAKE it, return directly with a DOWNRIGHT move to base and DROP it.
8. Total actions used = 7 + 8 + 4 = 19 actions (within the allowed 20).

Note:
• We never try to pick up from an empty cell.
• At no point do we carry more than 2 tokens.
• All moves remain inside the grid.
• Although each move “costs” 0.3 energy tokens, our aim is to maximize tokens deposited at the starting cell and our moves are planned as economically as possible within the 20‐action limit.
• The extra unused action is acceptable as we must not exceed 20 actions.

Let's think step by step.","<final_answer>
    [""LEFT"", ""TAKE"", ""DOWN"", ""TAKE"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DROP"", ""DROP"", ""DOWNRIGHT"", ""TAKE"", ""UPLEFT"", ""DROP"", ""LEFT"", ""LEFT"", ""TAKE"", ""RIGHT"", ""RIGHT"", ""DROP""]
</final_answer>

Below is the reasoning:

• We start at [3,7] (the starting cell). Notice that three energy tokens are immediately adjacent to A. In the grid these are:
  – [3,6] (to the LEFT),
  – [4,6] (DOWNLEFT), and
  – [4,8] (DOWNRIGHT).

• Our plan is to do three “round‐trips” from the starting cell subject to a 20–action limit:
  1. First trip: Pick up two tokens from adjacent cells [3,6] and [4,6] then return.
   – Action 1: ""LEFT"" moves from [3,7] to [3,6] where a token exists.
   – Action 2: ""TAKE"" picks the token at [3,6] (now carrying 1 token).
   – Action 3: ""DOWN"" moves from [3,6] to [4,6] (which has a token).
   – Action 4: ""TAKE"" picks the token at [4,6] (capacity reached: 2 tokens).
   – Action 5: ""UPRIGHT"" moves from [4,6] back to [3,7] (since the difference is –1 row, +1 column).
   – Actions 6–7: ""DROP"", ""DROP"" deposit the two tokens at the starting cell.
   This trip uses 7 actions.

  2. Second trip: Use an immediately adjacent token at [4,8].
   – Action 8: ""DOWNRIGHT"" moves from [3,7] to [4,8] (token present).
   – Action 9: ""TAKE"" picks up the token at [4,8].
   – Action 10: ""UPLEFT"" returns to [3,7].
   – Action 11: ""DROP"" deposits the token.
   This trip uses 4 actions.

  3. Third trip: With remaining actions (total so far 11, leaving 9 actions) we pick one token that isn’t immediately adjacent.
   Examine row 3: the cell [3,5] still holds a token (remember row 3 originally had tokens at col2, col4, col5, col6 – and [3,6] was already taken).
   We plan a roundtrip to [3,5]:
   – Action 12: ""LEFT"" moves from [3,7] to [3,6] (even though [3,6] is now empty, it is used just for transit).
   – Action 13: ""LEFT"" moves from [3,6] to [3,5].
   – Action 14: ""TAKE"" collects the token at [3,5]. (Now carrying 1 token.)
   – Actions 15–16: ""RIGHT"", ""RIGHT"" return us from [3,5] via [3,6] to [3,7].
   – Action 17: ""DROP"" deposits this token.
   This trip uses 6 actions.

Total actions so far: 7 + 4 + 6 = 17 actions (which is within the 20–action limit). The 3 remaining actions (unused) cannot further complete a roundtrip.

Notice that every move (the ones with directions) consumes 0.3 tokens as cost. In our scheme there are 9 moves in total. (Moves: ""LEFT"", ""DOWN"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"", ""UPLEFT"", ""LEFT"", ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""RIGHT"".) Their cost in tokens is 9 × 0.3 = 2.7 tokens. However, the score counts only tokens dropped (or originally present) in the start cell. In our plan we drop 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 tokens. (The tokens you hold are not counted.) 

Thus this plan deposits 4 energy tokens at the starting cell within 20 actions while obeying the movement, capacity, and cost rules.

    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.

Explanation:
• In our plan the starting cell is [6,6]. We plan three “trips” within 20 actions.
• Trip 1 (7 actions):
 – From [6,6] we go UP to [5,6] (which contains an energy token) and TAKE it.
 – Then we move RIGHT to [5,7] (which has a token) and TAKE it.
 – With two tokens (the carrying limit), we return diagonally DOWNLEFT back to [6,6] and perform two DROP actions to deposit both tokens.
• Trip 2 (7 actions):
 – Starting again at [6,6] we move LEFT to [6,5] (token present) and TAKE it.
 – Then we move UP to [5,5] (token present) and TAKE it.
 – We return diagonally DOWNRIGHT to [6,6] and DROP both tokens.
• Trip 3 (4 actions):
 – Finally, from [6,6] we move RIGHT to [6,7] (which still has its token) and TAKE it.
 – We immediately go LEFT back to [6,6] and DROP it.
• Total actions = 7 + 7 + 4 = 18 (within the 20‐action limit).
• All moves stay inside the grid and tokens are only taken when available.
• Only tokens dropped at [6,6] are counted at the end.

This sequence collects and deposits 5 energy tokens while obeying the constraints (and each movement costs 0.3 token but that cost is implicit in the game rules).",direct,openai/o3-mini,inner_cluster_block,True,False,True

    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.

    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.

    - ""TAKE"" to take the energy token
    - ""DROP"" to drop the energy token

    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:
    - You must not move out of the grid.
    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.
    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop).

Below is an explanation of the chosen sequence. We start in the cell [3,6] where “A” is located. Notice that among the eight neighbours of [3,6] only three cells contain a token:
 • [3,5] (to the LEFT) has an ""E"" 
 • [4,5] (DOWN from [3,5]) has an ""E"" 
 • [4,7] (DOWNRIGHT directly from [3,6]) has an ""E""

Because you may carry only 2 tokens at a time and every move–whether during a pickup or return–uses one action (and later you must explicitly ""DROP"" to deposit tokens at the start cell), a short‐roundtrip plan is needed.

Step‐by‐step:
1–7. Trip 1 (double‐pickup from adjacent cells):
 • Action1: ""LEFT"" moves from [3,6] to [3,5] where there is an ""E"".
 • Action2: ""TAKE"" collects the token at [3,5].
 • Action3: ""DOWN"" moves from [3,5] to [4,5] (this cell has an ""E"").
 • Action4: ""TAKE"" picks the token at [4,5].
 • Action5: ""UPRIGHT"" returns from [4,5] back to [3,6] (diagonally up‐right).
 • Actions6–7: Two ""DROP"" actions deposit both tokens at the starting cell.

8–11. Trip 2 (single adjacent pickup):
 • Action8: ""DOWNRIGHT"" goes from [3,6] to [4,7] (adjacent and contains ""E"").
 • Action9: ""TAKE"" collects the token.
 • Action10: ""UPLEFT"" returns to [3,6].
 • Action11: ""DROP"" deposits it.

12–17. Trip 3 (non‐adjacent pickup):
 • Action12: ""LEFT"" leaves [3,6] to [3,5] (even though the token originally there is now gone, you may pass through it).
 • Action13: ""LEFT"" moves from [3,5] to [3,4] where a token is available.
 • Action14: ""TAKE"" picks the token at [3,4].
 • Action15: ""RIGHT"" moves from [3,4] back to [3,5].
 • Action16: ""RIGHT"" moves from [3,5] to [3,6].
 • Action17: ""DROP"" deposits that token.

In total this sequence uses 17 actions (well within the 20‐action limit) and deposits 4 energy tokens in the start cell. The moves also obey grid boundaries and avoid obstacles (“O”) as required.",direct,openai/o3-mini,inner_cluster_block,True,False,True

    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.
    

    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:
    <final_answer>
        [""RIGHT"", ""TAKE"", ..., ""DROP""]
    </final_answer>

    
    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:
    - a direction to move in (""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"")
    - ""TAKE"" to take the energy token
    - ""DROP"" to drop the energy token

    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:
    - You must not move out of the grid.
    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.
    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). 
    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.
    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.
    - At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens
    - Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens

    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:
    - a direction to move in (""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"")
    - ""TAKE"" to take the energy token
    - ""DROP"" to drop the energy token

    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:
    - You must not move out of the grid.
    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.
    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). 
    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.
    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.

    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started.

    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.
    

    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:
    <final_answer>
        [""RIGHT"", ""TAKE"", ..., ""DROP""]
    </final_answer>

    
    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:
    - a direction to move in (""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"")
    - ""TAKE"" to take the energy token
    - ""DROP"" to drop the energy token

    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:
    - You must not move out of the grid.
    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.
    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). 
    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.
    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.
    - At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens
    - Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens
    Adhering to these rules is VERY IMPORTANT.

    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.

Explanation:
• First, starting at [6,5] we move four times to the right so that we reach [6,9] (which holds an E). We then execute “TAKE” to pick up that token.
• Next, we go “UPLEFT” to [5,8] (which has an E) and “TAKE” that as well (now holding 2 tokens—the maximum allowed).
• We then return to the starting cell by moving “DOWNLEFT”, “LEFT”, “LEFT” (bringing us back to [6,5]) and “DROP” the two tokens there.
• With 5 actions remaining (out of the 20‐action limit) we make a short extra trip. From [6,5] we go “UPRIGHT” to [5,6] (an adjacent cell with an E), “TAKE” that token, return “DOWNLEFT” to reach [6,5] again, and finally “DROP” that token.
• In all, we used 15 actions, remain within the 20–action limit, never leave the grid, and obey the carrying and move–cost rules. Only tokens dropped at starting cell count.",direct,openai/o3-mini,inner_leftRight_block,True,False,True

Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.
    

    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:
    <final_answer>
        [""RIGHT"", ""TAKE"", ..., ""DROP""]
    </final_answer>

    
    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:
    - a direction to move in (""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"")
    - ""TAKE"" to take the energy token
    - ""DROP"" to drop the energy token

    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:
    - You must not move out of the grid.
    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.
    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). 
    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.
    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.
    - At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens
    - Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens
    Adhering to these rules is VERY IMPORTANT.

    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.
    

    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:
    <final_answer>
        [""RIGHT"", ""TAKE"", ..., ""DROP""]
    </final_answer>

    
    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:
    - a direction to move in (""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"")
    - ""TAKE"" to take the energy token
    - ""DROP"" to drop the energy token

    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:
    - You must not move out of the grid.
    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.
    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). 
    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.
    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.
    - At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens
    - Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens
    Adhering to these rules is VERY IMPORTANT.

    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.

Below is an explanation of the plan.

We start at the cell [3,6] (the “home‐cell”). In our first “round trip” we go to an immediately adjacent cell that has a token. In this grid the only neighbor with an energy token is [2,7]. We do:
 • Move UPRIGHT from [3,6] to [2,7] (action 1),
 • TAKE the token (action 2),
 • Return by moving DOWNLEFT from [2,7] back to [3,6] (action 3) and then
 • DROP the token in the start‐cell (action 4).

Because you are carrying a token while moving back, you lose 0.3 tokens on that step so the net deposit from this round is about 1 – 0.3 = 0.7.

Next, we try to “pick up two tokens in one journey” to use fewer moves while carrying energy. For this we use two tokens that lie only two moves away. In the upper row the cells [1,5] and [1,4] both contain energy. Our round‐trip is as follows:
 • From [3,6] go UPLEFT to [2,5] (action 5),
 • then UP to [1,5] (action 6).
At [1,5] we TAKE the token (action 7). Then we move LEFT to [1,4] (action 8). (Moving with a carried token costs 0.3 so the token from [1,5] loses some “value”.) At [1,4] we TAKE that token (action 9). Now, with two tokens in hand we return to [3,6] by moving DOWNRIGHT twice:
 • DOWNRIGHT to [2,5] (action 10) and
 • DOWNRIGHT to [3,6] (action 11).
Finally we DROP the two tokens (actions 12 and 13). The two tokens together lose a total of 0.6 in value in the return moves so the net deposit from this round comes to about 0.7 (from the first token, after a 0.3 “spend”) plus 1 – (the 0.3 cost on the single move before picking up the second token and 0.6 on the two return moves) giving a total near 1.1 deposited.

Lastly, with our remaining actions we do a single‐token round trip to get a token that is two moves away downward. We use the token at [5,6] (in row 5, column 6). From [3,6]:
 • Move DOWN to [4,6] (action 14) then DOWN to [5,6] (action 15),
 • TAKE the token (action 16),
 • then return by moving UP twice (action 17 “UP” and action 18 “UP”). (Each move while carrying costs 0.3 so from 1 token you end with 1 – 0.6 = 0.4.)
 • Finally DROP the token (action 19).

Total actions used = 19 (within the limit of 20). 
The tokens “in hand” are only counted when dropped (or already in the home cell) so the final deposited total is about 0.7 + 1.1 + 0.4 = 2.2 energy tokens.

All moves stay inside the grid and obey the obstacle and carrying‐capacity rules.",direct,openai/o3-mini,inner_random_block,True,False,True

    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.
    

    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:
    <final_answer>
        [""RIGHT"", ""TAKE"", ..., ""DROP""]
    </final_answer>

    
    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:
    - a direction to move in (""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"")
    - ""TAKE"" to take the energy token
    - ""DROP"" to drop the energy token

    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:
    - You must not move out of the grid.
    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.
    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). 
    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.
    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.
    - At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens
    - Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens
    Adhering to these rules is VERY IMPORTANT.

    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:
    - You must not move out of the grid.
    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.
    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). 
    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.
    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.
    - At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens
    - Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens
    Adhering to these rules is VERY IMPORTANT.

    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started.

Explanation:
• Loop 1 (actions 1–8): From the start cell [3,5] the token at [4,4] (down‐left neighbor) is taken, then by moving right twice you reach [4,6] to take its token. A diagonal “UPLEFT” brings you directly back to [3,5] where you “DROP” both tokens.
• Loop 2 (actions 9–14): You move “RIGHT” twice from [3,5] to get from (3,5) → (3,6) → (3,7) where an energy token is located. You “TAKE” it, then go “LEFT” twice to return to [3,5] and “DROP” it.
• Loop 3 (actions 15–20): You move “LEFT” twice from [3,5] to reach (3,3) (via (3,4)) where a token is available. You “TAKE” it, then return with two “RIGHT” moves to get back to [3,5] and “DROP” it.

This full plan uses exactly 20 actions. (Note that each move action costs 0.3 tokens—but only tokens dropped (and those originally in the start cell) count as score.)",direct,openai/o3-mini,inner_random_free,True,False,True

    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.
    

    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:
    <final_answer>
        [""RIGHT"", ""TAKE"", ..., ""DROP""]
    </final_answer>

    
    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:
    - a direction to move in (""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"")
    - ""TAKE"" to take the energy token
    - ""DROP"" to drop the energy token

    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:
    - You must not move out of the grid.
    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.
    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). 
    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.
    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.
    - At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens
    - Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens
    Adhering to these rules is VERY IMPORTANT.

</final_answer> 

Explanation:
1. Starting at (3,7), we first go LEFT to (3,6) which contains ""E"", then TAKE that token.
2. We then return RIGHT to (3,7) and move RIGHT again to (3,8) (another token “E”), TAKE it.
3. Returning LEFT puts us back at starting cell where we perform two DROP actions (dropping both tokens). (Round 1: 2 tokens deposited)
4. Next, from (3,7) we move UPLEFT to (2,6) (an “E”), TAKE it.
5. From (2,6) we move UP to (1,6), where there is an “E”, TAKE it.
6. Then we return via DOWNRIGHT (moving from (1,6) to (2,7)) and DOWN to (3,7) and DROP both tokens. (Round 2: 2 tokens deposited)
7. Finally, with 4 actions left, we leave again: from (3,7) we move UPRIGHT to (2,8) (an “E”), TAKE it,
8. Then move DOWNLEFT back to (3,7) and DROP it. (Round 3: 1 token deposited)

This 20‐action plan obeys all the rules (moves stay inside the grid, tokens are only taken where present, carrying capacity is never over 2, and all collected tokens are dropped at the starting cell).",direct,openai/o3-mini,inner_random_free,True,False,True

Let me explain the plan briefly:

• Trip 1 (Actions 1–7): Starting at [7,3] the agent goes one cell left to [7,2] (which has an energy token), takes it, then moves diagonally down‐right to [8,3] (which also holds a token), takes that token, returns directly upward back to the start ([7,3]), and then drops both tokens. This round trip uses 7 actions.

• Trip 2 (Actions 8–17): Beginning again at [7,3], the agent heads via a diagonal and then right to reach [8,5] (after first moving DOWNRIGHT to [8,4] then RIGHT to [8,5]). It takes the token there, then moves further right to [8,6] and takes that token. With both tokens onboard, the agent uses a diagonal move UPLEFT and two LEFT moves to return to [7,3] and finally drops both tokens. This trip uses 10 actions.

Altogether, the sequence is 17 actions (which is under the 20‐action limit) and deposits a total of 4 energy tokens at the starting cell.",direct,openai/o3-mini,inner_spiral_block,True,False,True

    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.

    - ""DROP"" to drop the energy token

    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.
    

    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:
    <final_answer>
        [""RIGHT"", ""TAKE"", ..., ""DROP""]
    </final_answer>

    
    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:
    - a direction to move in (""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"")
    - ""TAKE"" to take the energy token
    - ""DROP"" to drop the energy token

    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:
    - You must not move out of the grid.
    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.
    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). 
    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.
    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.
    - At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens
    - Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens
    Adhering to these rules is VERY IMPORTANT.

    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.
    

    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:
    <final_answer>
        [""RIGHT"", ""TAKE"", ..., ""DROP""]
    </final_answer>

    
    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:
    - a direction to move in (""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"")
    - ""TAKE"" to take the energy token
    - ""DROP"" to drop the energy token

    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:
    - You must not move out of the grid.
    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.
    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). 
    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.
    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.
    - At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens
    - Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens
    Adhering to these rules is VERY IMPORTANT.

    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:
    - a direction to move in (""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"")
    - ""TAKE"" to take the energy token
    - ""DROP"" to drop the energy token

    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:
    - You must not move out of the grid.
    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.
    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). 
    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.
    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.
    - At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens
    - Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens
    Adhering to these rules is VERY IMPORTANT.

    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started.

Explanation:
• Our starting cell is [3,6]. In order to “deposit” energy (tokens) in that cell while losing as little value as possible from the transport‐cost (0.3 per move made while carrying a token), it is best to take tokens that are “adjacent” (only one move away on the return) when possible. 
• In our grid the cells [2,5], [3,7] and [4,7] each initially have an energy token and are reachable in one move from [3,6] (using “UPLEFT”, “RIGHT” and “DOWNRIGHT” respectively). For a round–trip that goes from [3,6] to one of those cells, we “TAKE” the token and immediately return to [3,6] in one step. That return motion, while carrying a token, costs 0.3 so that the token’s deposit value becomes 1 – 0.3 = 0.7.
• These three separate 4–action round–trips use 12 actions in total and deposit 0.7 per token (totalling 2.1).
• With the remaining actions (20 – 12 ≥ 6), we make one more round–trip in which we pick a token that is two moves away. Here we choose the token at [4,8]. We plan a two–move outward trip (“DOWNRIGHT” then “RIGHT”) carrying no token, so no cost is incurred on the way out. Then we “TAKE” the token; to return we choose a two–move route (“UPLEFT” then “LEFT”) while carrying the token. That return costs 2 × 0.3 = 0.6. Consequently, the deposit from that trip is 1 – 0.6 = 0.4.
• In all, the actions used are 18 – which is within the 20–action limit.
• Finally, only tokens dropped at [3,6] count toward the score.
  
This sequence therefore complies with the rules while “collecting” as many tokens as possible within 20 actions.",direct,openai/o3-mini,inner_upDown_block,True,False,True

</final_answer> 

Explanation:
• Starting at cell [4,6] (where “A” is), the first trip goes to two adjacent cells that hold tokens.
  – ""RIGHT"" moves you from [4,6] to [4,7] (which contains an “E”).
  – ""TAKE"" removes that token (now you are carrying 1).
  – ""DOWN"" moves from [4,7] to [5,7] (which has an “E”).
  – ""TAKE"" picks up the second token (carrying now 2, the capacity limit).
  – ""UPLEFT"" brings you back to the start ([4,6]).
  – Two successive ""DROP"" actions deposit both tokens in the starting cell.
• Then, with still unused actions (total so far 7, out of a 20‐action limit) you make a second trip to pick two more:
  – ""UPLEFT"" moves from [4,6] to [3,5] (this cell holds an “E”).
  – ""TAKE"" picks that token.
  – A second ""UPLEFT"" goes from [3,5] to [2,4] (which also contains an “E”).
  – ""TAKE"" picks up the token (now carrying 2).
  – Two ""DOWNRIGHT"" moves “diagonally” step–by–step bring you back to the start ([4,6]).
  – Two ""DROP"" actions deposit these tokens.
  
This 15–action plan obeys all rules (never leaving the grid, never stepping into an obstacle cell, not attempting to take from an empty cell, and carrying at most 2 tokens). Even though only 15 actions are used (which is within the 20–action limit), you end with 4 tokens dropped in the starting cell.",direct,openai/o3-mini,inner_upDown_block,True,False,True

    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.

</final_answer> 

Below is the reasoning behind this 18‐action plan (out of the allowed 20):

We start at [6,6] (where “A” is) and plan two “trips” that collect two energy tokens each (remember you can hold at most two at a time) and then return to [6,6] to “DROP” them.

Trip 1 (actions 1–7):
• Action 1: “LEFT” – move from [6,6] to [6,5] (no token is carried, so no step cost).
• Action 2: “TAKE” – pick up the token at [6,5].
• Action 3: “DOWNRIGHT” – move diagonally from [6,5] to [7,6]. Now you are carrying one token so this step “costs” 0.3 tokens.
• Action 4: “TAKE” – pick up the token at [7,6] (now you have two tokens).
• Action 5: “UP” – move from [7,6] directly back to [6,6] (again, while carrying tokens, this movement costs 0.3).
• Actions 6–7: “DROP”, “DROP” – drop both tokens at the starting cell. (Only dropped tokens count toward your score.)

Trip 2 (actions 8–18):
• Actions 8–10: “RIGHT”, “RIGHT”, “RIGHT” – travel from [6,6] to [6,9] through [6,7] and [6,8]. No tokens are carried so no cost applies.
• Action 11: “TAKE” – pick up the token at [6,9].
• Action 12: “DOWN” – move from [6,9] down to [7,9]; while carrying 1 token, this move costs 0.3.
• Action 13: “TAKE” – pick up the token at [7,9] (now carrying 2 tokens).
• Actions 14–16: “UPLEFT”, “LEFT”, “LEFT” – return from [7,9] to [6,6] by first going diagonally (reducing both row and column by 1) then two left moves. These 3 moves while in possession of tokens cost 0.3 each.
• Actions 17–18: “DROP”, “DROP” – drop the two tokens at the start.

Thus, in 18 actions we have collected and dropped four tokens at our start (the remaining 2 actions available out of 20 are unused). This plan obeys all the rules:
– All moves remain within the 11×11 grid.
– We only “TAKE” where an “E” is originally present.
– We never hold more than 2 tokens.
– We only “DROP” tokens at our starting cell.
– The movement (and its 0.3 cost each time when carrying) has been minimized while carrying tokens.

This is a valid and efficient solution to the game.",direct,openai/o3-mini,inner_upDown_block,True,False,True

We “play” by planning two short round‐trips from our starting cell [4,4]. In the first leg we go west to collect two tokens from the nearby cells [4,2] and [4,1] and return to [4,4] to drop them. In the second leg we head north to [3,4] (which is one cell “UP”) to take the token there, then swing south to [5,4] to take another token, and finally return “UP” back to [4,4] and drop those tokens. These 16 actions (6 moves in the left-trip plus 4 moves in the vertical trip, with the TAKE and DROP actions interleaved) total fewer than 20 actions while obeying the 2–token carrying limit and ensuring that the tokens finally dropped at the starting cell are the ones that count.",direct,openai/o3-mini,inner_upDown_free,True,False,True

    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: ""TAKE"" (take the energy in the current cell) and ""DROP"" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.
    

    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:
    <final_answer>
        [""RIGHT"", ""TAKE"", ..., ""DROP""]
    </final_answer>

    
    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:
    - a direction to move in (""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"")
    - ""TAKE"" to take the energy token
    - ""DROP"" to drop the energy token

    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:
    - You must not move out of the grid.
    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.
    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). 
    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.
    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.
    - At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens
    - Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens

At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.
    

    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:
    <final_answer>
        [""RIGHT"", ""TAKE"", ..., ""DROP""]
    </final_answer>

    
    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:
    - a direction to move in (""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"")
    - ""TAKE"" to take the energy token
    - ""DROP"" to drop the energy token

    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:
    - You must not move out of the grid.
    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.
    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). 
    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.
    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.
    - At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens
    - Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens
    Adhering to these rules is VERY IMPORTANT.

    You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: ""LEFT"", ""RIGHT"", ""UP"", ""DOWN"", ""UPLEFT"", ""UPRIGHT"", ""DOWNLEFT"", ""DOWNRIGHT"".
