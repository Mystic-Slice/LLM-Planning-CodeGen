This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: \"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"UP\", \"DOWN\", \"UPLEFT\", \"UPRIGHT\", \"DOWNLEFT\", \"DOWNRIGHT\". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: \"TAKE\" (take the energy in the current cell) and \"DROP\" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.\n    \n\n    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:\n    <final_answer>\n        [\"RIGHT\", \"TAKE\", ..., \"DROP\"]\n    </final_answer>\n\n    \n    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:\n    - a direction to move in (\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"UP\", \"DOWN\", \"UPLEFT\", \"UPRIGHT\", \"DOWNLEFT\", \"DOWNRIGHT\")\n    - \"TAKE\" to take the energy token\n    - \"DROP\" to drop the energy token\n\n    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:\n    - You must not move out of the grid.\n    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.\n    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). \n    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.\n    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.\n    - At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens\n    - Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens\n    Adhering to these rules is VERY IMPORTANT.\n\n    Think about this before writing your output.

We start in the cell [3,6] where \u201cA\u201d is located. Notice that among the eight neighbours of [3,6] only three cells contain a token:\n\u2003\u2022 [3,5] (to the LEFT) has an \"E\" \n\u2003\u2022 [4,5] (DOWN from [3,5]) has an \"E\" \n\u2003\u2022 [4,7] (DOWNRIGHT directly from [3,6]) has an \"E\"\n\nBecause you may carry only 2 tokens at a time and every move\u2013whether during a pickup or return\u2013uses one action (and later you must explicitly \"DROP\" to deposit tokens at the start cell), a short\u2010roundtrip plan is needed.\n\nStep\u2010by\u2010step:\n1\u20137.\u2003Trip\u00a01 (double\u2010pickup from adjacent cells):\n\u2003\u2022 Action1: \"LEFT\" moves from [3,6] to [3,5] where there is an \"E\".\n\u2003\u2022 Action2: \"TAKE\" collects the token at [3,5].\n\u2003\u2022 Action3: \"DOWN\" moves from [3,5] to [4,5] (this cell has an \"E\").\n\u2003\u2022 Action4: \"TAKE\" picks the token at [4,5].\n\u2003\u2022 Action5: \"UPRIGHT\" returns from [4,5] back to [3,6] (diagonally up\u2010right).\n\u2003\u2022 Actions6\u20137: Two \"DROP\" actions deposit both tokens at the starting cell.\n\n8\u201311.\u2003Trip\u00a02 (single adjacent pickup):\n\u2003\u2022 Action8: \"DOWNRIGHT\" goes from [3,6] to [4,7] (adjacent and contains \"E\").\n\u2003\u2022 Action9: \"TAKE\" collects the token.\n\u2003\u2022 Action10: \"UPLEFT\" returns to [3,6].\n\u2003\u2022 Action11: \"DROP\" deposits it.\n\n12\u201317.\u2003Trip\u00a03 (non\u2010adjacent pickup):\n\u2003\u2022 Action12: \"LEFT\" leaves [3,6] to [3,5] (even though the token originally there is now gone, you may pass through it).\n\u2003\u2022 Action13: \"LEFT\" moves from [3,5] to [3,4] where a token is available.\n\u2003\u2022 Action14: \"TAKE\" picks the token at [3,4].\n\u2003\u2022 Action15: \"RIGHT\" moves from [3,4] back to [3,5].\n\u2003\u2022 Action16: \"RIGHT\" moves from [3,5] to [3,6].\n\u2003\u2022 Action17: \"DROP\" deposits that token.\n\nIn total this sequence uses 17 actions (well within the 20\u2010action limit) and deposits 4 energy tokens in the start cell. The moves also obey grid boundaries and avoid obstacles (\u201cO\u201d) as required.", "method": "direct", "model": "openai/o3-mini"}
