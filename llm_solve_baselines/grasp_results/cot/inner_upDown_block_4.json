This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: \"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"UP\", \"DOWN\", \"UPLEFT\", \"UPRIGHT\", \"DOWNLEFT\", \"DOWNRIGHT\". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: \"TAKE\" (take the energy in the current cell) and \"DROP\" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.\n    \n\n    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:\n    <final_answer>\n        [\"RIGHT\", \"TAKE\", ..., \"DROP\"]\n    </final_answer>\n\n    \n    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:\n    - a direction to move in (\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"UP\", \"DOWN\", \"UPLEFT\", \"UPRIGHT\", \"DOWNLEFT\", \"DOWNRIGHT\")\n    - \"TAKE\" to take the energy token\n    - \"DROP\" to drop the energy token\n\n    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:\n    - You must not move out of the grid.\n    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.\n    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). \n    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.\n    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.\n    - At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens\n    - Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens\n    Adhering to these rules is VERY IMPORTANT.\n\n    Think about this before writing your output.

In the first \u201ctrip\u201d we deliberately bypass the token at [3,3] so we can later pick it with a cheap round\u2010trip. Instead, we go farther left to grab two tokens that lie at [3,2] and [3,1]. The sequence is:\n\u20031. \u201cLEFT\u201d \u2192 from [3,4] to [3,3] (passing by without taking the token there)\n\u20032. \u201cLEFT\u201d \u2192 arriving at [3,2] (which has an energy token)\n\u20033. \u201cTAKE\u201d \u2192 collect token from [3,2]\n\u20034. \u201cLEFT\u201d \u2192 move to [3,1] (which has a token)\n\u20035. \u201cTAKE\u201d \u2192 collect token from [3,1] (now carrying two tokens, the maximum)\n\u20036. \u201cRIGHT\u201d \u2192 go back to [3,2]\n\u20037. \u201cRIGHT\u201d \u2192 continue to [3,3]\n\u20038. \u201cRIGHT\u201d \u2192 return to starting cell [3,4]\n\u20039. \u201cDROP\u201d \u2192 drop one token at home\n\u200310. \u201cDROP\u201d \u2192 drop the second token  \n\u2003\u2003Now 2 tokens have been deposited.\n\n\u2022 For the second trip we take two tokens that are immediately adjacent to the start:\n\u200311. \u201cLEFT\u201d \u2192 move to [3,3] (this token was not picked earlier)\n\u200312. \u201cTAKE\u201d \u2192 pick token from [3,3]\n\u200313. \u201cRIGHT\u201d \u2192 return to [3,4]\n\u200314. \u201cRIGHT\u201d \u2192 go to [3,5] (which has a token)\n\u200315. \u201cTAKE\u201d \u2192 pick token from [3,5] (now full with 2 tokens)\n\u200316. \u201cLEFT\u201d \u2192 head back to [3,4]\n\u200317. \u201cDROP\u201d \u2192 drop one token\n\u200318. \u201cDROP\u201d \u2192 drop the second token  \n\u2003\u2003Now 2 additional tokens are deposited; the total deposited tokens become 4.\n\nThis plan uses 18 actions (leaving 2 spare) and obeys all rules: not stepping outside the grid, not taking from an empty cell, not carrying more than 2 at a time, and only dropping tokens when back at the start.", "method": "cot", "model": "openai/o3-mini"}
