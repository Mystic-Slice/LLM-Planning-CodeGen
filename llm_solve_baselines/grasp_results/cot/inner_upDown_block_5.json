This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: \"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"UP\", \"DOWN\", \"UPLEFT\", \"UPRIGHT\", \"DOWNLEFT\", \"DOWNRIGHT\". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: \"TAKE\" (take the energy in the current cell) and \"DROP\" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.\n    \n\n    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:\n    <final_answer>\n        [\"RIGHT\", \"TAKE\", ..., \"DROP\"]\n    </final_answer>\n\n    \n    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:\n    - a direction to move in (\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"UP\", \"DOWN\", \"UPLEFT\", \"UPRIGHT\", \"DOWNLEFT\", \"DOWNRIGHT\")\n    - \"TAKE\" to take the energy token\n    - \"DROP\" to drop the energy token\n\n    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:\n    - You must not move out of the grid.\n    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.\n    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). \n    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.\n    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.\n    - At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens\n    - Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens\n    Adhering to these rules is VERY IMPORTANT.\n\n    Think about this before writing your output.

Our objective is to pick up tokens from elsewhere and then return and DROP them so they count for our score. Because we can carry at most 2 tokens at a time, it makes sense to \u201cbatch\u2010\u201d when possible.\n\n\u2022 Round Trip 1 (Actions 1\u20137):  \n\u2003\u2013 Move RIGHT to [4,7] (which contains a token \u201cE\u201d)  \n\u2003\u2013 TAKE the token  \n\u2003\u2013 Then move DOWN to [5,7] (another token \u201cE\u201d)  \n\u2003\u2013 TAKE the second token  \n\u2003\u2013 Move UPLEFT to return directly from [5,7] to [4,6]  \n\u2003\u2013 DROP the first token  \n\u2003\u2013 DROP the second token  \nAfter this round, our starting cell now has 2 tokens (score = 2) and we have used 7 actions.\n\n\u2022 Round Trip 2 (Actions 8\u201311):  \n\u2003\u2013 From [4,6] move UPLEFT to [3,5] (an adjacent diagonal cell that holds an \u201cE\u201d)  \n\u2003\u2013 TAKE that token  \n\u2003\u2013 Return by moving DOWNRIGHT from [3,5] back to [4,6]  \n\u2003\u2013 DROP the token at home  \nNow our score increases by 1 (total = 3) and we have used 4 additional actions (total 11).\n\n\u2022 Round Trip 3 (Actions 12\u201317):  \n\u2003\u2013 With 9 actions left we plan a relatively short trip for another token.  \n\u2003\u2013 From [4,6] move UPRIGHT to [3,7] (this intermediate cell is empty)  \n\u2003\u2013 Then move RIGHT to [3,8] where a token \u201cE\u201d is located  \n\u2003\u2013 TAKE this token  \n\u2003\u2013 Return by moving DOWNLEFT from [3,8] to [4,7]  \n\u2003\u2013 Then move LEFT from [4,7] to get back to [4,6]  \n\u2003\u2013 Finally, DROP the token  \nThis adds one more token to our score (total = 4) and uses 6 actions (overall 17 actions used).\n\nWe end with 17 actions, which is under the 20\u2013action limit. All moves stay on the grid, tokens are taken only where they exist, we never hold more than 2 tokens, and we drop tokens only in the starting cell.", "method": "cot", "model": "openai/o3-mini"}
