This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: \"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"UP\", \"DOWN\", \"UPLEFT\", \"UPRIGHT\", \"DOWNLEFT\", \"DOWNRIGHT\". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: \"TAKE\" (take the energy in the current cell) and \"DROP\" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.\n    \n\n    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:\n    <final_answer>\n        [\"RIGHT\", \"TAKE\", ..., \"DROP\"]\n    </final_answer>\n\n    \n    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:\n    - a direction to move in (\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"UP\", \"DOWN\", \"UPLEFT\", \"UPRIGHT\", \"DOWNLEFT\", \"DOWNRIGHT\")\n    - \"TAKE\" to take the energy token\n    - \"DROP\" to drop the energy token\n\n    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:\n    - You must not move out of the grid.\n    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.\n    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). \n    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.\n    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.\n    - At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens\n    - Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens\n    Adhering to these rules is VERY IMPORTANT.\n\n    Think about this before writing your output.

Starting at [6,6], the plan is to make short round\u2010trips so that we pick tokens and then return to [6,6] to drop them. (Only tokens dropped at the starting cell count toward your score, and you can carry at most 2 at a time.) \n\nRound Trip 1 (8 actions):\n\u2013 Action 1: \u201cLEFT\u201d moves you from [6,6] to [6,5] where an energy token \u201cE\u201d is present.\n\u2013 Action 2: \u201cTAKE\u201d picks up the token at [6,5].\n\u2013 Action 3: \u201cRIGHT\u201d moves you back to [6,6].\n\u2013 Action 4: \u201cRIGHT\u201d moves you to [6,7] (another adjacent cell with \u201cE\u201d).\n\u2013 Action 5: \u201cTAKE\u201d picks up the token at [6,7] (now carrying 2 tokens).\n\u2013 Action 6: \u201cLEFT\u201d brings you back to [6,6].\n\u2013 Actions 7\u20138: \u201cDROP\u201d, \u201cDROP\u201d to deposit both tokens at the start cell.\n\nRound Trip 2 (7 actions):\n\u2013 Action 9: \u201cUP\u201d moves you from [6,6] to [5,6] where there is an \u201cE.\u201d\n\u2013 Action 10: \u201cTAKE\u201d picks up the token at [5,6].\n\u2013 Action 11: \u201cLEFT\u201d takes you to [5,5] (which also has an \u201cE\u201d).\n\u2013 Action 12: \u201cTAKE\u201d picks up that token (now 2 in hand).\n\u2013 Action 13: \u201cDOWNRIGHT\u201d moves you diagonally from [5,5] back to [6,6].\n\u2013 Actions 14\u201315: \u201cDROP\u201d, \u201cDROP\u201d deposit both tokens.\n\nRound Trip 3 (4 actions):\n\u2013 Action 16: \u201cUPRIGHT\u201d moves you diagonally from [6,6] to [5,7] (an adjacent cell with an \u201cE\u201d).\n\u2013 Action 17: \u201cTAKE\u201d picks up the token.\n\u2013 Action 18: \u201cDOWNLEFT\u201d takes you back to [6,6].\n\u2013 Action 19: \u201cDROP\u201d deposits this single token.\n\nThese 19 actions (within the 20\u2010action limit) ensure you deposit a total of 5 energy tokens at the starting cell. (Movement steps naturally cost 0.3 tokens each, but here the focus is on maximizing the tokens deposited by efficient, short trips.)", "method": "cot", "model": "openai/o3-mini"}
