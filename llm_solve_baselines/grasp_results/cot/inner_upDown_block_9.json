This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: \"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"UP\", \"DOWN\", \"UPLEFT\", \"UPRIGHT\", \"DOWNLEFT\", \"DOWNRIGHT\". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: \"TAKE\" (take the energy in the current cell) and \"DROP\" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.\n    \n\n    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:\n    <final_answer>\n        [\"RIGHT\", \"TAKE\", ..., \"DROP\"]\n    </final_answer>\n\n    \n    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:\n    - a direction to move in (\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"UP\", \"DOWN\", \"UPLEFT\", \"UPRIGHT\", \"DOWNLEFT\", \"DOWNRIGHT\")\n    - \"TAKE\" to take the energy token\n    - \"DROP\" to drop the energy token\n\n    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:\n    - You must not move out of the grid.\n    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.\n    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). \n    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.\n    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.\n    - At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens\n    - Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens\n    Adhering to these rules is VERY IMPORTANT.\n\n    Think about this before writing your output.

Our plan is to make several short \u201cround\u2010trip\u201d excursions to nearby adjacent cells so that when we return to [6,4] we drop the tokens we picked up.\n  \n\u2022 In our first round trip we choose two adjacent cells that are \u201cneighbors\u201d both to [6,4] and to each other. For example, moving UP from [6,4] lands in [5,4] (which holds an \u201cE\u201d). After a TAKE there we then move LEFT to [5,3] (also containing an \u201cE\u201d), TAKE that token and then return with a single \u201cDOWNRIGHT\u201d move back to [6,4]. Finally we DROP both tokens (one DROP per token). This 7\u2010action sequence nets 2 tokens deposited.\n  \n\u2022 Then we do a one\u2013token trip: from [6,4] we go UPRIGHT to [5,5], TAKE the token there, return via DOWNLEFT to [6,4] and then DROP it. (This one\u2013token trip uses 4 actions.)\n  \n\u2022 Next we go for the fourth token with another similar one\u2013token trip: from [6,4] we move DOWNRIGHT to [7,5], TAKE the token and return via UPLEFT back to the start, then DROP it (again 4 actions).\n  \n\u2022 In total our sequence uses 7 + 4 + 4 = 15 actions (leaving us spare actions under the 20\u2013action limit) and deposits 4 tokens at the start.\n\nThis strategy obeys the rules (never going off\u2013grid, only taking tokens where present, never exceeding a 2\u2013token capacity and using only allowed actions) and maximizes our collection given the constraints.", "method": "cot", "model": "openai/o3-mini"}
