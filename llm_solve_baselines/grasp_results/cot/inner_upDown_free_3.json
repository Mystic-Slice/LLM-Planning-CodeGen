This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: \"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"UP\", \"DOWN\", \"UPLEFT\", \"UPRIGHT\", \"DOWNLEFT\", \"DOWNRIGHT\". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: \"TAKE\" (take the energy in the current cell) and \"DROP\" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.\n    \n\n    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:\n    <final_answer>\n        [\"RIGHT\", \"TAKE\", ..., \"DROP\"]\n    </final_answer>\n\n    \n    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:\n    - a direction to move in (\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"UP\", \"DOWN\", \"UPLEFT\", \"UPRIGHT\", \"DOWNLEFT\", \"DOWNRIGHT\")\n    - \"TAKE\" to take the energy token\n    - \"DROP\" to drop the energy token\n\n    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:\n    - You must not move out of the grid.\n    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.\n    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). \n    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.\n    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.\n    - At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens\n    - Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens\n    Adhering to these rules is VERY IMPORTANT.\n\n    Think about this before writing your output.

Starting at [5,6] (where \u201cA\u201d is), the idea is to make a short \u201cround\u2010trip\u201d to pick up up to 2 tokens (remember carrying capacity is 2) and return with them to deposit at the start.\n\n\u2022 Trip 1 \u2013 2 tokens:\n\u2003a. Action 1: \"DOWNLEFT\" moves to [6,5] (an adjacent cell that has an \u201cE\u201d).\n\u2003b. Action 2: \"TAKE\" to pick up the token at [6,5].\n\u2003c. Action 3: \"RIGHT\" moves to [6,6] where another \"E\" is.\n\u2003d. Action 4: \"TAKE\" picks up that token.\n\u2003e. Action 5: \"UP\" brings you back to [5,6].\n\u2003f. Actions 6\u20137: \u201cDROP\u201d then \u201cDROP\u201d deposit the two tokens.\n\n2. Trip 2 \u2013 2 tokens:\n\u2003a. Action 8: \"UP\" moves from [5,6] to [4,6] (which contains an \u201cE\u201d).\n\u2003b. Action 9: \"TAKE\" its token.\n\u2003c. Action 10: \"RIGHT\" moves to [4,7] (another \u201cE\u201d is here).\n\u2003d. Action 11: \"TAKE\" collects that token.\n\u2003e. Action 12: \"DOWNLEFT\" returns to [5,6].\n\u2003f. Actions 13\u201314: Two \"DROP\" actions deposit both tokens.\n\n3. Trip 3 \u2013 1 token:\n\u2003a. Action 15: \"UPLEFT\" moves from [5,6] to [4,5] (an adjacent cell with an \u201cE\u201d).\n\u2003b. Action 16: \"TAKE\" picks up that token.\n\u2003c. Action 17: \"DOWNRIGHT\" moves back from [4,5] to [5,6].\n\u2003d. Action 18: \"DROP\" deposits the token.\n\nThis 18\u2010action plan (well within the 20\u2013action limit) collects 5 tokens in total on the starting cell. Note that every movement \u201cstep\u201d costs 0.3 energy tokens, so minimizing length of trips is important. The above route uses short moves and collects tokens from cells immediately adjacent to the starting cell.\n\nAll moves remain within the grid and obey capacity/direction rules.", "method": "cot", "model": "openai/o3-mini"}
