This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: \"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"UP\", \"DOWN\", \"UPLEFT\", \"UPRIGHT\", \"DOWNLEFT\", \"DOWNRIGHT\". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: \"TAKE\" (take the energy in the current cell) and \"DROP\" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.\n    \n\n    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:\n    <final_answer>\n        [\"RIGHT\", \"TAKE\", ..., \"DROP\"]\n    </final_answer>\n\n    \n    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:\n    - a direction to move in (\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"UP\", \"DOWN\", \"UPLEFT\", \"UPRIGHT\", \"DOWNLEFT\", \"DOWNRIGHT\")\n    - \"TAKE\" to take the energy token\n    - \"DROP\" to drop the energy token\n\n    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:\n    - You must not move out of the grid.\n    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.\n    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). \n    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.\n    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.

Notice that several neighboring cells contain an energy token. In our plan we make five \u201cround\u2010trip\u201d sub\u2010routines. In each sub\u2010routine we:\n\u2003\u2013 leave the starting cell while empty (so no movement cost is \u201cpaid\u201d on a carried token),\n\u2003\u2013 move to one of the adjacent cells that holds an \u201cE\u201d, use \u201cTAKE\u201d to pick it up,\n\u2003\u2013 return immediately to [4,5] (this move is with a carried token so it costs 0.3 tokens) and then \n\u2003\u2013 \u201cDROP\u201d the token \u2013 which deposits it at the start (only dropped tokens count toward your score).\n\u2022 The five trips (each using 4 actions) sum to 20 actions, and all moves remain inside the grid.\n\u2022 This simple strategy obeys the restrictions (carrying at most one token at a time until drop and not exceeding 20 actions) and maximizes the tokens returned in our allowed budget of moves.\n  \nUse this sequence as your final answer.", "method": "cot", "model": "openai/o3-mini"}
