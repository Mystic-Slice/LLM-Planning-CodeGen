This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within 20 actions and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. Positions in the grid will be in the format [row, column] and the numbering starts from zero. [0, 0] denotes top left corner. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in 8 directions: \"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"UP\", \"DOWN\", \"UPLEFT\", \"UPRIGHT\", \"DOWNLEFT\", \"DOWNRIGHT\". You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: \"TAKE\" (take the energy in the current cell) and \"DROP\" (drop the energy you are carrying on to the current cell). At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens. Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens. Your task is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score.\n    \n\n    And finally when you are ready to give your final answer, you can output in this form:\n    <final_answer>\n        [\"RIGHT\", \"TAKE\", ..., \"DROP\"]\n    </final_answer>\n\n    \n    Your final answer must be a list of actions where each action is one of the following:\n    - a direction to move in (\"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"UP\", \"DOWN\", \"UPLEFT\", \"UPRIGHT\", \"DOWNLEFT\", \"DOWNRIGHT\")\n    - \"TAKE\" to take the energy token\n    - \"DROP\" to drop the energy token\n\n    Make sure to check the following in your final answer:\n    - You must not move out of the grid.\n    - You must not take energy from a cell that does not have energy.\n    - You must not use more than 20 actions (includes movement, take and drop). \n    - You must not use any other actions than the ones specified above.\n    - After all the actions, only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Tokens you are holding onto do not count.\n    - At any point you can carry only 2 energy tokens\n    - Each step costs you 0.3 energy tokens\n    Adhering to these rules is VERY IMPORTANT.\n\n    Think about this before writing your output.

We want to deposit as many energy tokens as possible (only tokens dropped at start count).\u2003  \n\u2022 We know that among the 8 neighbors of [3,6] only three hold energy (cells [3,5], [4,5] and [4,7]). However, one token is \u201ctwo\u2010steps away\u201d (at [3,4]) that in a separate trip would cost extra moves.  \n\u2022 To maximize our result in no more than 20 actions we \u201cbundle\u201d two tokens in one trip when possible.  \n\nIn the plan above we do:\n1. A two\u2010token round trip \u201cleftward\u201d that goes:\n\u2003 \u2013 from [3,6] LEFT \u2192 [3,5] (token present) then TAKE,\n\u2003 \u2013 further LEFT to [3,4] (token present) then TAKE,\n\u2003 \u2013 return to [3,6] via RIGHT, RIGHT and then DROP (twice) to deposit those two tokens.\nThis uses 8 actions.  \n\n2. A one\u2010token round trip downward\u2010left into cell [4,5] (which is adjacent) using DOWNLEFT, TAKE, UPRIGHT and DROP (4 actions).  \n\n3. A one\u2010token round trip downward\u2010right into cell [4,7] (also adjacent) using DOWNRIGHT, TAKE, UPLEFT and DROP (4 actions).  \n\nThat gives a total of 8+4+4=16 actions (leaving 4 spare, which is acceptable as the limit is 20). Only the tokens dropped at the starting cell are scored, and we end having deposited 4 tokens.  \n\nThis sequence obeys all the movement, capacity, and turn\u2010limit rules.", "method": "cot", "model": "openai/o3-mini"}
