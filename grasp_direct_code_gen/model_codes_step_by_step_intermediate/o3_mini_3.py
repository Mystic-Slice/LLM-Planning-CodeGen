    Collect energy tokens ('E') from the grid and drop them at the starting cell.
    
    Parameters:
       grid: 2D list of strings. Each cell contains "E" for energy, "A" for the starting cell/agent, or " " for empty.
       start_position: Tuple (row, col) for the starting position (where 'A' is located).
       max_actions: Total number of allowed actions (each move, TAKE, or DROP counts as one).
       is_diagonals_allowed: Boolean indicating if diagonal moves are permitted.
       carry_limit: Maximum number of tokens the agent can carry at once.
       cost_per_step: A float cost that is incurred per movement (each directional step).
       
    Returns:
       A tuple (actions, net_tokens) where:
         - actions is the list of actions taken (e.g., "UP", "DOWNRIGHT", "TAKE", "DROP", etc.),
