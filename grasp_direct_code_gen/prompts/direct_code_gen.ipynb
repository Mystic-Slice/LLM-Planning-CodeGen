    "You are a game playing agent. This game involves a 2-D grid which you have to traverse and get as many energy tokens as possible within a given number of actions (called `max_actions`) and put the collected energy back in the cell where you started. You are denoted by the letter 'A', the energy tokens are denoted by the letter 'E' and obstacles if any are denoted by the letter 'O'. You can move in '4 ('four') directions: \"LEFT\", \"RIGHT\", \"UP\" and \"DOWN\"' or 8 ('eight') directions including \"UPLEFT\", \"UPRIGHT\", \"DOWNLEFT\" and \"DOWNRIGHT\", if diagonals are allowed (boolean parameter called `is_diagonals_allowed`). You can also perform two additional actions on the cell you are in currently: \"TAKE\" (take the energy in the current cell) and \"DROP\" (drop all the energy tokens you are carrying on to the current cell). You will also have a limit on the amount of energy tokens you can carry at any time (called `carry_limit`) and also a energy cost per step that you take in any of the different directions (called `cost_per_step`) which will be subtracted from the total energy tokens collected at the end. The goal is to collect as many energy tokens as possible and drop them back in the cell where you started. The energy tokens you are holding onto do not count towards your score. Only the tokens dropped or already present in your starting cell count towards your score. Make sure to drop your collected tokens in your starting cell. Come up with a strategy that would solve this game as optimally as possible. One grid is given as example, you can use that to understand the format. Give me the pseudocode for your strategy. You do not have to focus on writing the actual running code. The output of the algorithm must be the list of actions taken. Make sure to focus on the solution strategy and come with a good strategy that works on any given grid and any given constraints. Ensure your code doesnt cause any errors like out of grid bounds, etc...\n",
